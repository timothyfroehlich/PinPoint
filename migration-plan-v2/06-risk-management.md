# Risk Management Plan: Migration Risk Mitigation

**Purpose**: Comprehensive risk mitigation addressing psychological and technical challenges of architectural migration  
**Context**: Solo development with 306 failing tests and dual-ORM complexity  
**Critical Success Factor**: Maintaining dependency chain discipline against shortcut temptations

---

## 1. Risk Categories Overview

### Psychological Risks (HIGHEST PRIORITY)

- **Mid-Progress Energy Dip Danger Zone** - Slow progress triggers test-fixing impulses
- **Dependency Chain Breaking** - Pressure to work on tests before RLS completion
- **Shortcut Temptation** - 306 failing tests create urgency for quick wins
- **Architecture Abandonment** - Starting RLS then reverting to symptom fixes

### Technical Risks (HIGH PRIORITY)

- **RLS Implementation Complexity** - Multi-tenant session management challenges
- **Dual-ORM Conflicts** - Impossible mixed states during transition
- **Database Transaction Issues** - Context switching between ORMs
- **Performance Degradation** - Query optimization blocked by architecture

### External Risks (MODERATE PRIORITY)

- **External Pressure** - Deadlines forcing shortcuts
- **Scope Creep** - Feature requests during migration
- **Environment Issues** - Development setup problems

---

## 2. Critical Dependency Chain Enforcement

### Iron Law of Migration Phases

```
Phase 1: Complete Prisma Removal
    ‚Üì (DEPENDENCY GATE)
Phase 2: RLS Session Management
    ‚Üì (DEPENDENCY GATE)
Phase 2.5: Test Methodology Definition
    ‚Üì (DEPENDENCY GATE)
Phase 3: Systematic Test Fixes
    ‚Üì (DEPENDENCY GATE)
Phase 4: Optimization & Cleanup
```

### Dependency Gate Checklist

**Before Phase 2 (RLS)**:

- [ ] Zero Prisma references in codebase
- [ ] All routers using pure Drizzle
- [ ] tRPC context has single database client
- [ ] TypeScript compilation passes

**Before Phase 2.5 (Test Methodology)**:

- [ ] RLS session management working
- [ ] User context properly scoped
- [ ] Test database can create isolated sessions
- [ ] Basic CRUD operations with RLS functional

**Before Phase 3 (Test Fixes)**:

- [ ] Test methodology documented
- [ ] Example test conversion completed
- [ ] Pattern validation with 2-3 test files
- [ ] Confidence in approach established

### Enforcement Mechanisms

**Session Dependency Check**:

```bash
# Automated dependency validation
npm run validate-migration-phase

# Manual check questions:
# 1. Am I working on the current phase only?
# 2. Are all prerequisites complete?
# 3. Is there pressure to skip ahead?
```

**Temptation Resistance Protocol**:

1. **STOP** - When feeling urge to fix tests early
2. **BREATHE** - Acknowledge the psychological pressure
3. **REDIRECT** - Focus on current phase work only
4. **COMMIT** - Make small progress on current phase

---

## 3. Psychological Risk Management

### Mid-Progress Energy Dip Danger Zone

**Risk Profile**: Peak vulnerability when initial progress slows  
**Trigger**: Frustration with architectural work vs quick test fixes  
**Mitigation Strategy**:

**Session Preparation**:

- Set realistic session goals (architecture takes time)
- Pre-commit to mid-session protocol
- Identify 1-2 small wins for the session

**Mid-Session Protocol** (when energy drops):

- [ ] Take break from code
- [ ] Review session's actual progress (often more than perceived)
- [ ] Read success mantras aloud
- [ ] Commit to one more small step only

**Session Completion Review**:

- Document actual progress made
- Acknowledge architectural work is less visible but critical
- Plan next session's small wins

### Shortcut Temptation Management

**306 Failing Tests Pressure**:

- **Reality Check**: Tests fail because architecture is broken
- **Mantra**: "Fixing symptoms creates more complexity"
- **Visual Reminder**: Keep Strategic Framework open

**Quick Win Alternatives**:
Instead of test fixes, satisfy need for progress with:

- Documentation updates
- Code organization improvements
- Development environment enhancements
- Migration progress tracking

### Architecture Abandonment Prevention

**Warning Signs**:

- Thinking "RLS is too complex, let me just fix tests"
- Starting to work on test mocks during RLS phase
- Justifying shortcuts with "temporary" fixes

**Prevention Protocol**:

1. **Session Architecture Commitment** - Read out loud before each session
2. **Progress Visualization** - Track RLS implementation steps
3. **Abandonment Cost Reminder** - Multiple sessions lost, returning to same issues
4. **Small Steps Approach** - Break RLS into granular tasks

---

## 4. Technical Risk Mitigation

### RLS Implementation Challenges

**Risk**: Complex multi-tenant session management  
**Preparation Strategy**:

- Research Supabase RLS patterns thoroughly
- Create simple test case first
- Use Context7 for latest documentation
- Plan rollback points between sessions

**Session Implementation Protocol**:

- Start with simplest possible RLS policy
- Test with single user scenario first
- Gradually add complexity
- Document every working state

**Complexity Management**:

- Break RLS into micro-features
- Test each component independently
- Keep working backup at each milestone
- Accept imperfect initial implementation

### Dual-ORM Transition Risks

**Impossible Mixed States Prevention**:

- Complete Phase 1 (Prisma removal) before any RLS work
- Never mix Prisma and Drizzle in same operation
- Use TypeScript compilation as safety net
- Maintain clear service layer boundaries

**Database Context Switching**:

- Single database client throughout application
- Consistent transaction management approach
- Clear separation of concerns
- No cross-ORM operations

### Performance & Query Optimization

**Risk**: Blocked optimization during architectural transition  
**Strategy**: Accept temporary performance issues

- Focus on correctness first
- Document performance concerns for Phase 4
- Avoid premature optimization
- Plan dedicated optimization phase

---

## 5. Early Warning Systems

### Session Check-In Protocol

**Session Start Assessment**:

- Current phase progress: On track / Behind / Ahead
- Temptation level: Low / Medium / High
- Technical blockers: None / Minor / Major
- Psychological state: Focused / Pressured / Frustrated

**Mid-Session Pulse Check**:

- Am I working on current phase only?
- Any pressure to skip ahead?
- Technical issues requiring help?
- Need for break or context switch?

**Session End Review**:

- Actual progress vs expectations
- Lessons learned this session
- Next session's focus area
- Risk level for next session

### Automated Warning Triggers

**Code Quality Warnings**:

```bash
# Run every commit
if grep -r "prisma" src/ --exclude-dir=__tests__; then
  echo "‚ö†Ô∏è  WARNING: Prisma reference found during Phase 2+"
fi

if [[ "$MIGRATION_PHASE" == "2" ]] && grep -r "test.*fix" commits/; then
  echo "üö® DANGER: Test fix commits during RLS phase"
fi
```

**Behavioral Warnings**:

- Multiple failed attempts at same task (try different approach)
- Extended sessions without breaks (burnout risk)
- Committing to "temporary" solutions (architecture abandonment)

### Community Warning Signs

**External Pressure Indicators**:

- Feature requests during migration
- Questions about timeline
- Pressure to show "working" features

**Response Protocol**:

- Acknowledge requests without commitment
- Explain migration necessity
- Provide realistic timeline
- Protect migration focus time

---

## 6. Contingency Planning

### RLS Implementation Stalled

**Scenario**: RLS proving more complex than expected  
**Decision Tree**:

**If making some progress**:

- Extend effort allocation
- Simplify RLS scope temporarily
- Focus on basic user scoping only
- Plan RLS enhancement for Phase 4

**If completely blocked**:

- Rollback to Phase 1 complete state
- Research alternative approaches
- Consider consultant for RLS guidance
- Re-evaluate migration strategy

### Technical Blockers

**Database Migration Issues**:

- Maintain rollback SQL scripts
- Test migration/rollback cycle regularly
- Keep development data minimal
- Document all schema changes

**Development Environment Problems**:

- Maintain Docker fallback environment
- Document environment setup steps
- Keep dependency versions locked
- Plan for environment rebuilds

**Integration Failures**:

- Isolate failing components
- Build minimal reproduction cases
- Research similar issues online
- Plan alternative implementation approaches

### Psychological Breakdown

**Overwhelm Scenarios**:

- Too many technical decisions
- Progress feeling too slow
- Architecture complexity exceeding comfort

**Recovery Protocol**:

1. **STOP** all development work
2. **STEP BACK** for extended break
3. **SIMPLIFY** current task to smallest possible unit
4. **RESTART** with tiny step

**Support Resources**:

- Online communities (Supabase Discord, Reddit)
- Documentation re-reading
- Code examples from other projects
- Consultant as last resort

---

## 7. Abort Criteria & Rollback

### Phase-Specific Abort Triggers

**Phase 1 (Prisma Removal)**:

- **Abort if**: Multiple sessions with no progress
- **Rollback to**: Previous commit before phase start
- **Recovery**: Research specific conversion issues

**Phase 2 (RLS Implementation)**:

- **Abort if**: Extended effort without basic user scoping working
- **Rollback to**: Phase 1 complete state
- **Recovery**: Alternative session management approach

**Phase 3 (Test Fixes)**:

- **Abort if**: Test methodology proves unworkable after substantial test conversion effort
- **Rollback to**: Phase 2 complete state
- **Recovery**: Re-evaluate test strategy

### Rollback Procedures

**Git Safety Protocol**:

```bash
# Before each phase
git checkout -b migration-phase-N-backup
git tag migration-phase-N-start

# Regular backups
git checkout -b session-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)

# Emergency rollback
git checkout migration-phase-N-backup
git branch -D current-work-branch
```

**State Restoration**:

- Database schema rollback scripts
- Environment variable restoration
- Dependency version restoration
- Documentation state tracking

### Decision Framework for Abort

**Technical Abort Criteria**:

- Fundamental architecture assumption proven wrong
- Required functionality impossible with chosen approach
- Technical debt exceeding migration benefits

**Psychological Abort Criteria**:

- Consistent decision fatigue
- Inability to make progress across multiple sessions
- Architecture decisions becoming random

**Recovery Planning**:

- Alternative migration strategies
- Consultant engagement criteria
- Partial migration acceptance
- Feature development restart conditions

---

## 8. Progress Tracking Strategy

### Migration-Focused Metrics (Not Test-Focused)

**Phase 1 Progress**:

- Prisma references removed: X/Y files
- Routers converted: X/Y routers
- Services updated: X/Y services
- TypeScript compilation: Pass/Fail

**Phase 2 Progress**:

- RLS policies created: X/Y entities
- User scoping working: Yes/No
- Session management: Basic/Advanced
- CRUD operations with RLS: X/Y working

**Phase 3 Progress**:

- Test methodology: Defined/Applied
- Test files converted: X/Y files
- Test patterns documented: X/Y patterns
- Green test rate: X% (only track during Phase 3)

### Progress Between Sessions

**Avoid**:

- Overall test pass rate (creates pressure)
- Feature completion percentage (misleading during migration)
- Performance metrics (not relevant during architecture work)

**Focus On**:

- Architecture milestones completed
- Understanding gained of new patterns
- Problems solved and documented
- Small wins in current phase

### Visual Progress Tools

**Architecture Completion Dashboard**:

```
Phase 1: Prisma Removal
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚úÖ Router conversion complete
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚úÖ Service layer updated
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚úÖ Context simplified
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ‚úÖ Dependencies removed

## 6. Migration Approach Selection Criteria

### **Strategic Context Assessment for Future Migrations**

**Lessons from Prisma‚ÜíDrizzle Direct Conversion Success:**

The strategic decision to use **direct conversion** vs **parallel validation** was critical to migration success. These criteria should guide future architectural changes.

### **Context Assessment Framework**

**Project Context Factors:**

```
Team Size Assessment:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Solo Development ‚Üí Direct Conversion ‚úÖ (Proven successful)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Small Team (2-3) ‚Üí Direct Conversion with coordination

```

### **Risk Tolerance Matrix**

| Project Context                         | Technical Foundation     | Recommended Approach | Timeline                      |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Solo + Pre-Beta + High Isolation        | ‚úÖ **Direct Conversion** | 2-3 weeks            | ‚úÖ **Proven Success**         |
| Small Team + Beta + Good Coverage       | Direct Conversion        | 3-4 weeks            | Consider if velocity critical |
| Large Team + Production + Poor Coverage | Parallel Validation      | 6-8 weeks            | Standard enterprise approach  |
| Enterprise + SLA + Monolithic           | Staged Migration         | 10+ weeks            | Only safe option              |

### **Direct Conversion Success Indicators (Retrospective)**

**What Made Direct Conversion Work:**

- **Solo context** eliminated coordination overhead
- **Pre-beta environment** provided high error tolerance
- **tRPC router isolation** prevented cascade failures
- **Existing converted routers** provided proven patterns
- **TypeScript compilation** caught most errors immediately
- **Good test coverage** provided confidence in changes

**Red Flags That Would Have Required Different Approach:**

- Multiple developers needing coordination
- Production users requiring zero downtime
- Tightly coupled architecture with cascade risks
- Unknown territory without proven patterns
- Poor TypeScript coverage allowing silent errors
- No existing test safety net

### **Decision Framework for Future Changes**

**Assessment Questions:**

1. **Context**: Solo development or team coordination required?
2. **Users**: Can we afford temporary breaks or zero-downtime required?
3. **Foundation**: Do we have proven patterns or entering unknown territory?
4. **Architecture**: Are components isolated or tightly coupled?
5. **Safety Net**: Do we have TypeScript + tests or flying blind?

**Decision Matrix:**

- **3+ "Low Risk" answers** ‚Üí Direct Conversion
- **Mixed answers** ‚Üí Parallel Validation
- **3+ "High Risk" answers** ‚Üí Staged Migration

### **Velocity vs Safety Trade-off Framework**

**When to Optimize for Velocity (Direct Conversion):**

- Solo development context with high learning value
- Pre-production environment with error tolerance
- Well-understood migration with proven patterns
- Strong technical foundation (TypeScript, tests, isolation)

**When to Optimize for Safety (Parallel Validation):**

- Team development requiring coordination
- Production environment with user impact concerns
- Unknown territory migration requiring validation
- Weak technical foundation requiring extra verification

**When to Optimize for Certainty (Staged Migration):**

- Enterprise context with SLA requirements
- Critical production systems with zero error tolerance
- Complex migrations with multiple unknowns
- Regulatory/compliance requirements for gradual change

### **Strategic Implementation Insights**

**Methodology Principles (from successful direct conversion):**

- **Component-by-component approach** (router-by-router for us)
- **Immediate validation** after each component
- **TypeScript compilation** as primary safety mechanism
- **Manual testing** of key flows before moving forward
- **Easy rollback strategy** (`git checkout filename.ts`)

**Quality Standards (proven effective):**

- Build must pass after each conversion
- Key user flows must function correctly
- Organizational scoping must be maintained
- Performance must be acceptable

**Risk Mitigation (validated approach):**

- Incremental progress with immediate feedback
- Strong technical safety nets (TypeScript, tests)
- Easy rollback options at every step
- Focus on learning over pure speed

## Risk Management Session Workflow

### Session Start Ritual

1. **Read Success Mantras** for current phase
2. **Check Dependency Gates** - am I in the right phase?
3. **Set Session Goal** for current work
4. **Identify Temptation Risks** for the session
5. **Plan Contingency** if goal not met

### Mid-Session Check

1. **Assess Current Temptation Level** (test fixing urges)
2. **Validate Phase Discipline** (still working on current phase?)
3. **Technical Progress Check** (moving forward or stuck?)
4. **Psychological State** (frustrated, focused, overwhelmed?)

### Session Completion Review

1. **Document Progress Made** (often more than perceived)
2. **Identify Lessons Learned**
3. **Assess Next Session's Risks**
4. **Update Contingency Plans** if needed
5. **Celebrate Architecture Wins** (invisible but critical progress)

---

**Success Reminder**: This migration succeeds through disciplined phase execution, not test-passing metrics. Architecture work is invisible but foundational. Resist symptom fixes, trust the dependency chain, and maintain faith in the strategic approach.

**Emergency Mantra**: "I stop fixing symptoms and focus on architecture. I trust the process and resist shortcuts. I build the foundation right, then everything else becomes possible."
