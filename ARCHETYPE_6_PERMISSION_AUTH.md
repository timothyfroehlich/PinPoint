- **Schema Constraint Issues**: 7 tests with missing database schema exports

## Failing Tests Analysis

### src/server/auth/**tests**/permissions.test.ts

**Tests Failing**: 15/21 tests
**Security Focus**: Role-based permission validation and organizational scoping
**Failure Type**: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')
**Error Message**: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')"
**Security Risk**: Permission validation system completely broken - could allow unauthorized access
**Fix Assessment**: Schema export issue - rolePermissions not properly exported from schema mock
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Core permission system failure

### src/server/api/**tests**/trpc.permission.test.ts

**Tests Failing**: 4/21 tests
**Security Focus**: tRPC middleware permission enforcement with organizational boundaries
**Failure Type**: Missing required permission validation and cross-organizational permission isolation
**Error Message**: "expected [Function] to throw error including 'Missing required permission'" / "Cannot read properties of undefined"
**Security Risk**: Permission middleware not properly blocking unauthorized access across organizations
**Fix Assessment**: Both schema export issues and RLS context establishment needed
**Priority**: CRITICAL - tRPC security middleware failure

### src/server/services/**tests**/roleService.test.ts

**Tests Failing**: 3/14 tests
**Security Focus**: Role management service with template role creation
**Failure Type**: Missing rolePermissions export in schema mock
**Error Message**: "No 'rolePermissions' export is defined on the '~/server/db/schema' mock"
**Security Risk**: Role service operations could fail in production, affecting permission assignment
**Fix Assessment**: Schema mock needs to include rolePermissions export
**Priority**: HIGH - Service layer security operations

### src/integration-tests/admin.integration.test.ts

**Tests Failing**: 11/11 tests
**Security Focus**: Admin router operations with organizational isolation
**Failure Type**: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'referencedTable')
**Error Message**: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'referencedTable')"
**Security Risk**: Complete admin functionality failure - no admin operations possible
**Fix Assessment**: Drizzle relational query configuration issue affecting admin operations
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Admin security operations completely broken

### src/integration-tests/role.integration.test.ts

**Tests Failing**: 32/32 tests (most security-critical)
**Security Focus**: Role management with multi-tenant isolation and permission validation
**Failure Type**: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'referencedTable')
**Error Message**: "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'referencedTable')"
**Security Risk**: Role-based access control system completely non-functional
**Fix Assessment**: Same Drizzle relational configuration issue as admin tests
**Priority**: CRITICAL - Complete RBAC system failure

### src/components/issues/**tests**/IssueDetailView.auth.integration.test.tsx

**Tests Failing**: 2/9 tests
**Security Focus**: UI component authentication and permission-based feature visibility
**Failure Type**: UI elements not reflecting proper permission states
**Error Message**: "expect(element).toBeEnabled() - Received element is not enabled"
**Security Risk**: UI not properly reflecting user permissions - could show inaccessible features
**Fix Assessment**: Auth context integration with React components needs fixing
**Priority**: MEDIUM - UI security feedback mechanism

### Permission Matrix Failures (Cross-cutting)

**Pattern**: Tests across multiple files failing due to "You don't have permission to access this organization"
**Security Focus**: Cross-organizational boundary enforcement
**Failure Type**: tRPC context not properly establishing organizational membership
**Error Message**: "You don't have permission to access this organization"
**Security Risk**: Either over-restrictive (blocking valid access) or under-restrictive (if bypassable)
**Fix Assessment**: Need proper session context establishment with organizational scoping
**Priority**: HIGH - Multi-tenant security boundary enforcement

## Security Patterns and Recommendations

- **RLS Context Requirements**: 15 files needing proper session context with organizational scoping
- **Multi-Tenant Boundaries**: 8 files needing cross-org isolation fixes with membership validation
- **Permission Matrix Validation**: 20 files needing role-based access control integration
- **Schema Integrity**: All security tests need proper rolePermissions schema export

## Security Fix Priority Matrix

**Critical Priority (Data Security)**:

- src/server/auth/**tests**/permissions.test.ts - Core permission system failure
- src/integration-tests/admin.integration.test.ts - Admin security operations broken
- src/integration-tests/role.integration.test.ts - RBAC system completely non-functional
- src/server/api/**tests**/trpc.permission.test.ts - Security middleware failure

**High Priority (Access Control)**:

- All tests showing "You don't have permission to access this organization" - organizational boundary enforcement
- Machine owner tests with missing seeded users - ownership-based access control
- Cross-organizational data access prevention

**Medium Priority (Permission Enforcement)**:

- UI component permission reflection
- Role template and service layer operations
- Permission matrix completeness validation

**Low Priority (Schema Validation)**:

- Mock schema completion for test environment consistency
- Permission description and constant validation

## Critical Security Architecture Issues

1. **Complete Permission System Breakdown**: Core hasPermission/requirePermission functions failing due to schema export issues
2. **tRPC Security Middleware Failure**: Permission enforcement at API layer not working
3. **Admin Operations Security Void**: Complete admin functionality failure creates security management gap
4. **RBAC System Non-Functional**: Role-based access control completely broken across all integration tests
5. **Cross-Organizational Boundary Confusion**: Inconsistent enforcement suggesting RLS context issues

## Immediate Security Remediation Required

1. Fix rolePermissions schema export in all test mocks
2. Resolve Drizzle relational query configuration for admin and role operations
3. Establish proper RLS session context for organizational boundary testing
4. Validate tRPC permission middleware functionality with real security scenarios
5. Test complete permission matrix across all organizational boundaries

These failures represent a critical security architecture breakdown requiring immediate attention to prevent unauthorized access in production.
