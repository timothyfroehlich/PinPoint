## Failing Tests Analysis

### src/integration-tests/cross-org-isolation.test.ts

**Tests Failing**: 19/20 tests (CRITICAL SECURITY FAILURE)
**Security Focus**: Multi-tenant organizational isolation and RLS policy enforcement
**Failure Type**: RLS policies not enforcing organizational boundaries
**Error Message**: "expected false to be true // Object.is equality", "expected [...] to have a length of +0 but got 3"
**Security Risk**: **ZERO-TOLERANCE DATA LEAKAGE VIOLATION** - Users can see other organizations' data
**Fix Assessment**: Complete RLS implementation needed - policies not working in PGlite tests
**Priority**: **CRITICAL - IMMEDIATE SECURITY BREACH**

**Specific Failures**:

- "users can only see data from their own organization" - **DATA LEAKAGE CONFIRMED**
- "cross-organization data queries return empty results" - **ISOLATION BREACH**
- "organizational isolation verification utility works correctly" - **VERIFICATION SYSTEM BROKEN**
- "joins across related tables maintain organizational isolation" - **RELATIONAL DATA LEAKAGE**
- "aggregation queries respect organizational boundaries" - **AGGREGATION LEAKAGE**
- "different user roles see appropriate data within organization" - **ROLE-RLS INTEGRATION FAILURE**
- "cross-organization access attempts are blocked" - **ACCESS CONTROL FAILURE**

### src/integration-tests/machine.owner.integration.test.ts

**Tests Failing**: 19/19 tests
**Security Focus**: Machine ownership context and cross-organizational access control
**Failure Type**: Missing seeded test users and improper ownership context
**Error Message**: "Missing seeded test users"
**Security Risk**: Machine ownership security not testable - ownership-based access control unvalidated
**Fix Assessment**: RLS context establishment for machine ownership relationships
**Priority**: HIGH - Ownership-based access control validation

### Comment/Issue Router Integration Tests (Multiple files)

**Tests Failing**: Various counts across integration test files
**Security Focus**: Resource access with organizational scoping
**Failure Type**: "You don't have permission to access this organization"
**Error Message**: Generic organizational access denial
**Security Risk**: Either over-restrictive blocking valid access OR under-restrictive if bypassable
**Fix Assessment**: Need proper RLS session context with organizational membership validation
**Priority**: HIGH - Could indicate RLS over-enforcement or context setup issues

### Performance and Security Auditing Tests

**Tests Failing**: Multiple in cross-org-isolation.test.ts
**Security Focus**: RLS policy performance and comprehensive security validation
**Failure Type**: RLS queries performing poorly and security audit failures
**Error Message**: "expected 366.76 to be less than 100", "comprehensive security audit passes"
**Security Risk**: RLS policies may not be optimized, could impact production performance
**Fix Assessment**: RLS policy optimization and comprehensive security audit implementation
**Priority**: MEDIUM - Performance impact on security enforcement

## Security Patterns and Recommendations

- **RLS Context Requirements**: ALL 28 files need proper PostgreSQL RLS session context establishment
- **Multi-Tenant Boundaries**: 22 files need complete RLS policy implementation with organizational scoping
- **Permission Matrix Validation**: 6 files need RLS integration with role-based access control
- **Schema Integrity**: 2 files need RLS policy coordination with database constraints

## Security Fix Priority Matrix

**Critical Priority (IMMEDIATE SECURITY BREACH)**:

- **src/integration-tests/cross-org-isolation.test.ts**: Zero-tolerance data leakage violations
  - Users accessing other organizations' data
  - Cross-organizational queries returning data instead of empty results
  - JOIN queries leaking related organizational data
  - Aggregation queries exposing cross-org information

**High Priority (Access Control)**:

- **Machine ownership context**: Machine owner tests failing due to missing ownership context setup
- **Resource access validation**: Comment/issue routers with organizational access denials
- **Role-RLS integration**: Different user roles not seeing appropriately scoped data

**Medium Priority (Policy Enforcement)**:

- **RLS performance optimization**: Security policies performing below acceptable thresholds
- **Comprehensive security auditing**: Security audit framework not passing validation
- **Edge case validation**: Complex query patterns and RLS policy interaction

**Low Priority (Infrastructure)**:

- **Test pattern integration**: RLS helpers integrating with existing test infrastructure
- **Memory usage optimization**: RLS test patterns with stable memory usage

## Critical RLS Architecture Issues

### **Phase 3.3b Lessons Applied**

Based on the analysis, we can see the exact issues identified in Phase 3.3b:

1. **RLS Context Establishment Failure**: Tests are not properly establishing PostgreSQL session context:

   ```typescript
   // MISSING: Proper RLS context setup
   await db.execute(sql`SET app.current_organization_id = ${orgId}`);
   await db.execute(sql`SET app.current_user_id = ${userId}`);
   await db.execute(sql`SET app.current_user_role = ${userRole}`);
   ```

2. **PGlite RLS Limitation**: PGlite cannot test real RLS policies due to missing Supabase auth.jwt() functions

3. **Cross-Organizational Data Leakage**: Complete failure of organizational isolation

### **Immediate RLS Remediation Required**

1. **Implement pgTAP RLS Testing**:
   - Move RLS policy validation to `supabase/tests/rls/` with native PostgreSQL
   - Use pgTAP for proper RLS policy enforcement testing
   - Validate auth.jwt() integration with organizational boundaries

2. **Fix PGlite Business Logic Tests**:
   - Use PGlite only for business logic with BYPASSRLS role
   - Properly establish organizational context for business logic testing
   - Ensure seeded test users are available for ownership context

3. **Establish RLS Session Context**:
   - Implement withRLSContext helper for proper session variable setup
   - Validate organizational membership before setting context
   - Ensure proper user role context for permission integration

4. **Comprehensive Security Audit**:
   - Implement security audit framework to validate organizational isolation
   - Performance test RLS policies under realistic load
   - Validate zero data leakage across ALL organizational boundaries

## **SECURITY CLASSIFICATION: CRITICAL**

**These RLS test failures represent the most severe security vulnerability category:**

- **Data Breach Potential**: Users can access other organizations' data
- **Multi-Tenant Isolation Failure**: Complete breakdown of organizational boundaries
- **Compliance Violation Risk**: GDPR and data protection regulation violations
- **Production Security Gap**: RLS policies may not be working in production

**Immediate Action Required**:

1. Implement proper RLS testing with pgTAP
2. Fix cross-organizational data leakage
3. Validate organizational boundary enforcement
4. Test complete permission matrix with RLS integration

This archetype represents the highest priority security fixes due to direct data protection implications.
