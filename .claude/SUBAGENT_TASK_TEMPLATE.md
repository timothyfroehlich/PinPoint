- **Development Phase**: Pre-production (frequent schema changes, no migrations)

### Relevant Files

[List key files the agent will need to work with]

## Prerequisites

[Any dependencies or setup requirements]

## Implementation Steps

1. [Specific step with file references and expected outcomes]
2. [Another step with detailed guidance]
3. [Continue with implementation details]

### Database Changes (if applicable)

- **Migration notes**: Use `npm run db:push` for schema sync (pre-production)
- **Seed data**: [Any seed data requirements]

### Frontend Changes (if applicable)

- **Components**: [List components to create/modify]
- **Pages**: [List pages to create/modify]

### Backend Changes (if applicable)

- **tRPC routes**: [List API routes to create/modify]
- **Middleware**: [Any middleware changes]
- **Authentication**: [Auth-related changes]

## Quality Requirements

- **TypeScript**: `npm run typecheck` must pass with zero errors
- **ESLint**: `npm run lint` must pass with zero errors
- **Testing**: `npm run test` must pass with 50% coverage minimum
- **Pre-commit**: `npm run pre-commit` must pass completely
- **Code Standards**: Follow existing patterns and conventions

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit tests**: [Specific test requirements]
- **Integration tests**: [If applicable]
- **Test coverage**: Must meet project minimums (50% global, 60% server/, 70% lib/)

## Success Criteria

- [ ] [Specific measurable outcome]
- [ ] [Another measurable outcome]
- [ ] [Quality gates passed]
- [ ] [Final validation step]

## Validation Steps

1. Run `npm run validate` - all checks must pass
2. Run `npm run dev:full` - application starts without errors
3. Test the implemented feature manually
4. Verify all quality requirements are met

## Completion Instructions

When your task is complete:

1. Ensure all quality requirements are met
2. Run `npm run pre-commit` - it must pass completely
3. Commit your changes with descriptive messages following project conventions
4. Update this task file with completion notes in the section below
5. Notify the orchestrator - DO NOT clean up the worktree yourself
6. The orchestrator will handle worktree cleanup after confirmation

## Progress Notes

[Agent should update this section with progress and any issues encountered]

### Completion Summary
