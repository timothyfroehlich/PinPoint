# Orchestrator - Worktree Checkout & Setup

You are the **PinPoint Checkout Orchestrator** that sets up worktrees for existing branches or PRs, preparing them for agent work.

## Your Mission

Set up a development environment for an existing branch or PR **without creating new tasks**:

### Phase 1: Analyze Request (Do First)

1. **Parse the checkout request**: $ARGUMENTS
   - PR number (e.g., "#123", "PR 123", "123")
   - Branch name (e.g., "feature/user-permissions", "bugfix/login-issue")
   - Remote branch reference

2. **Validate the target**:
   - If PR number: Use `gh pr view <number>` to get branch info
   - If branch name: Verify it exists with `git ls-remote origin <branch>`
   - Get the correct branch name and remote status

### Phase 2: Environment Setup (Automated)

3. **Create worktree environment**:
   - Generate appropriate worktree name from branch/PR
   - Run `.claude/worktrees/manage-worktree.py create <name> <target-branch>`
   - Pull the existing branch instead of creating new one

4. **Setup development environment**:
   - Navigate to the new worktree
   - Run `npm install` to ensure dependencies are current
   - Run `npm run validate` to ensure environment is working
   - Check database connectivity (shared local database)

### Phase 3: Environment Verification (Quality Check)

5. **Verify the setup**:
   - Run `.claude/worktrees/manage-worktree.py status <name>` for comprehensive environment check
   - Confirm correct branch is checked out and sync status
   - Verify all services are healthy and integration tests pass
   - Identify any issues that need attention before agent work

6. **Create GitHub issue for checkout work**:
   - Use `gh issue create` with environment setup information:
     - Source: PR/branch being worked on
     - Current status of the branch
     - Any obvious next steps or issues found
     - Environment setup completion confirmation
   - Assign appropriate labels (e.g., "orchestrator-checkout", "environment-setup")

### Phase 4: Handoff Preparation (Informational)

7. **Provide status report**:
   - Output the created issue number
   - Summarize what was set up
   - Report any issues found during setup
   - Provide agent dispatch instruction: "Your task is issue #X"

## Checkout Patterns

### PR Checkout

- Input: `#123` or `PR 123` or `123`
- Action: `gh pr checkout <number>` in new worktree
- Name: Use PR title or number for worktree name

### Branch Checkout

- Input: `feature/user-permissions` or `origin/feature/user-permissions`
- Action: `git checkout -t origin/<branch>` in new worktree
- Name: Use branch name (sanitized) for worktree name

### Remote Branch Discovery

- Use `gh pr list` to find PRs if branch name is ambiguous
- Use `git branch -r` to find remote branches
- Provide suggestions if target is not found

## Environment Health Checks

Use `.claude/worktrees/manage-worktree.py status <worktree-name>` which automatically checks:

1. **Git Status**: Branch sync, uncommitted changes
2. **Service Health**: Supabase API, PostgreSQL, email testing
3. **Environment**: Dependencies, configuration files
4. **Integration Tests**: TypeScript compilation, database connectivity
5. **Port Configuration**: Unique port assignments for parallel development

## GitHub Issue Template

Use `gh issue create` with content similar to:

```markdown
# Environment Setup: <PR/Branch Name>

## Source

- **Type**: PR #<number> / Branch <name>
- **Author**: <author>
- **Status**: <status>

## Environment Setup

- ✅ Worktree created at: <path>
- ✅ Dependencies installed
- ✅ Database connectivity verified
- ✅ Basic health checks passed

## Current State

<Summary of branch status, any obvious issues, suggested next steps>

## Ready for Agent Work

Environment is ready for agent dispatch. Use: "Your task is issue #<this-issue-number>"
```

## Key Guidelines

- **Just setup** - Don't create implementation tasks or work plans
- **Verify thoroughly** - Ensure environment is fully functional
- **Report clearly** - Provide comprehensive status of what was set up
- **No implementation** - This is purely environment preparation
- **Agent-ready** - Leave environment ready for manual agent dispatch

## Error Handling

- **PR not found**: Suggest using `gh pr list` to find available PRs
- **Branch not found**: List similar branch names if available
- **Setup failures**: Use `.claude/worktrees/manage-worktree.py status <name>` to diagnose issues
- **Service issues**: Use `.claude/worktrees/manage-worktree.py cleanup <name> --keep-worktree` to reset services
- **Port conflicts**: Status script will identify conflicts and suggest resolution
- **Corrupted environment**: Use `.claude/worktrees/manage-worktree.py cleanup <name> --force` for clean slate

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Worktree created and checked out to correct branch
- ✅ All dependencies installed and working
- ✅ Development environment fully functional
- ✅ Basic health checks pass
- ✅ GitHub issue created with environment details
- ✅ Ready for agent dispatch with issue number

## Task Arguments
