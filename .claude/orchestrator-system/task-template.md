2. [CUJ coverage requirements]
3. [Test organization and structure]

### For Implementation Agents

1. [Implementation-specific steps]
2. [Code patterns to follow]
3. [Integration requirements]

### For Review Agents

1. [Review criteria and checklist]
2. [Quality gate verification]
3. [PR management steps]

### Database Changes (if applicable)

- **Schema modifications**: [Describe any Prisma schema changes needed]
- **Migration notes**: Use `npm run db:push:local` for schema sync (pre-production)
- **Seed data**: [Any seed data requirements]

- **Middleware**: [Any middleware changes]
- **Authentication**: [Auth-related changes]

## Success Criteria

- [ ] [Specific measurable outcome]
- [ ] [Another measurable outcome]
- [ ] [Quality gates passed]
- [ ] [Final validation step]

## Validation Steps

1. Run `npm run validate` - all checks must pass
2. Run `npm run dev:full` - application starts without errors
3. Test the implemented feature manually
4. Verify all quality requirements are met

## Completion Instructions

### For Test Agents

1. Ensure all tests run and initially fail (red phase of TDD)
2. Commit tests with `--no-verify` if pre-commit hooks block test-only commits
3. Update this task file with test coverage achieved
4. Notify orchestrator that tests are ready for implementation

### For Implementation Agents

1. Ensure all tests pass (green phase of TDD)
2. Run `npm run pre-commit` - must pass completely
3. Commit changes with descriptive messages
4. Push to remote and create PR targeting `epic/backend-refactor`
5. Wait for all GitHub Actions to complete
6. Update this task file with implementation summary
7. Notify orchestrator with PR link and CI/CD status

### For Review Agents

1. Conduct thorough code review
2. Address all automated feedback (GitHub Copilot, etc.)
3. Ensure all quality gates pass
4. Set PR to auto-merge when ready
5. Wait up to 5 minutes for merge completion
6. Update this task file with review outcomes
7. Notify orchestrator of merge status

**All Agents**: DO NOT clean up the worktree yourself - the orchestrator will handle cleanup after confirmation

## Progress Notes

[Agent should update this section with progress and any issues encountered]

### Completion Summary

[Fill this in when task is complete]

- **Changes made**: [Summary of changes]
- **Files modified**: [List of files changed]
- **Testing completed**: [What was tested]
- **Quality checks**: [Confirmation all checks passed]
