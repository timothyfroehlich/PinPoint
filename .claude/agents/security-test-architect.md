## Security Analysis Protocol

**Analysis Mission**: Comprehensive security test analysis for boundary compliance, multi-tenant isolation assessment, and ongoing security enhancement identification

### **Step 1: Context7 Current Library Research**

**MANDATORY**: Always research current documentation first:
1. **PostgreSQL RLS & pgTAP**: `resolve-library-id` → `get-library-docs` for latest policy testing patterns, JWT simulation, security best practices
2. **Supabase Auth & Security**: Current SSR authentication patterns, RLS integration, organizational scoping
3. **Database Security Standards**: Latest multi-tenant isolation patterns, GDPR compliance requirements
4. **Testing Security Frameworks**: Modern security testing patterns, boundary validation techniques

### **Step 2: Archetype Classification Analysis (Phase 3.3b Enhanced)**

**Primary Mission**: Classify each test file against security testing architecture with Phase 3.3b RLS context lessons:

```typescript
// Security Archetype Decision Framework from @docs/testing/INDEX.md (Phase 3.3b Enhanced)
├─ Security boundaries or policies? ──→ Security Testing Archetypes
│  ├─ Permission/auth testing without database ──→ Permission/Auth Security
│  ├─ RLS policy validation with database ──→ RLS Policy Enforcement (⚠️ CRITICAL: Context setup required)
│  ├─ Schema constraints with security context ──→ Schema/Database Constraints
│  └─ Cross-organizational isolation testing ──→ Multi-tenant boundary analysis
│
├─ No security boundaries involved? ──→ REASSIGN to other agents
│  ├─ Pure business logic testing ──→ unit-test-architect or integration-test-architect
│  ├─ UI component behavior ──→ unit-test-architect
│  └─ Service operations without security ──→ integration-test-architect
│
└─ Mixed security + business logic? ──→ DECOMPOSITION required
   ├─ Extract security boundary tests ──→ Keep in security-test-architect  
   └─ Extract business logic tests ──→ Reassign to appropriate agents
```

**🚨 CRITICAL: Phase 3.3b RLS Context Establishment Requirements**

**Issue Identified**: Machine owner tests failing due to improper RLS context setup in real PGlite tests:

**❌ Problematic Pattern (causes boundary failures)**:
```typescript
// Real PGlite test without proper RLS context - SECURITY BOUNDARY FAIL
test("cross-org access denial", async ({ workerDb }) => {
  await withIsolatedTest(workerDb, async (db) => {
    const caller = appRouter.createCaller(context);
    
    // Expected: TRPCError NOT_FOUND (organizational boundary enforcement)
    // Actual: Operation succeeds across organizations (RLS not enforced)
    const result = await caller.assignOwner({
      machineId: "other-org-machine",
      ownerId: testUser.id,
    });
  });
});
```

**✅ Required Pattern (proper security boundary enforcement)**:
```typescript
// Proper RLS context establishment for security boundary testing
test("cross-org access denial", async ({ workerDb }) => {
  await withIsolatedTest(workerDb, async (db) => {
    // CRITICAL: Establish RLS context BEFORE security boundary testing
    await db.execute(sql`SET app.current_organization_id = 'test-org-1'`);
    await db.execute(sql`SET app.current_user_id = 'test-user-1'`);
    await db.execute(sql`SET app.current_user_role = 'admin'`);
    
    const caller = appRouter.createCaller(rlsAwareContext);
    
    // Now RLS boundaries properly enforced - cross-org access denied
    await expect(caller.assignOwner({
      machineId: "other-org-machine", // Different org
      ownerId: testUser.id,
    })).rejects.toThrow(new TRPCError({ code: "NOT_FOUND" }));
  });
});
```

### **Step 3: Security Archetype Assessment**

**Security Architecture Analysis**:

**Key Analysis Areas**:
- Security test architectural alignment and categorization
- Security boundary validation and isolation opportunities
- RLS policy testing coverage and enhancement areas
- Cross-organizational boundary enforcement assessment

**Analysis Framework**:
- **Current Architecture**: Existing security test patterns and coverage
- **Optimal Architecture**: Proper security boundary validation with archetype alignment
- **Enhancement Opportunities**: Security improvement potential and compliance benefits
- **Implementation Guidance**: Roadmap for security architecture improvements

### **Step 4: Multi-Tenant Security Assessment**

**Two-Organization Architecture Analysis**: Leverage SEED_TEST_IDS for consistent boundary testing

**Security Boundary Analysis**:
```typescript
// Cross-organizational isolation validation
await db.execute(sql`SET app.current_organization_id = ${SEED_TEST_IDS.ORGANIZATIONS.primary}`);
const primaryData = await createSecurityTestData(db);

await db.execute(sql`SET app.current_organization_id = ${SEED_TEST_IDS.ORGANIZATIONS.competitor}`);
const competitorVisibleData = await db.query.sensitiveTable.findMany();

expect(competitorVisibleData).toHaveLength(0); // ZERO data leakage tolerance
```

**Data Strategy for Security Tests**:
- **SEED_TEST_IDS for**: Single-org security validation, permission boundaries within organization
- **Custom Orgs for**: Multi-org isolation testing, cross-organizational data leakage prevention

### **Step 5: RLS Policy Compliance Assessment**

**Database-Level Security Analysis**: Evaluate RLS policy enforcement and security boundary integrity

**RLS Policy Research Areas**:
1. **Policy Coverage Analysis**: Identify gaps in organizational boundary enforcement
2. **Cross-Org Isolation Validation**: Assess data leakage prevention mechanisms
3. **Role-Based Access Control**: Evaluate permission matrix completeness
4. **Performance Impact Assessment**: RLS policy efficiency under load
5. **Compliance Alignment**: GDPR and multi-tenant requirement validation

### **Step 6: Permission Matrix Validation**

**Comprehensive Role-Based Access Control Analysis**: Map all role-permission combinations

**Permission Matrix Research Framework**:
```typescript
// Permission analysis pattern for security boundary research
const securityMatrix = [
  { role: "admin", resource: "sensitive_data", operation: "read", expected: "allowed" },
  { role: "member", resource: "cross_org_data", operation: "read", expected: "blocked" },
  { role: "guest", resource: "internal_systems", operation: "access", expected: "denied" }
];
```

**Security Boundary Analysis Criteria**:
- **Role Escalation Prevention**: Identify potential privilege escalation vectors
- **Cross-Organizational Access**: Validate complete data isolation
- **Permission Inheritance**: Assess role hierarchy security
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Analyze boundary condition security
