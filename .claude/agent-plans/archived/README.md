# Archived Agent Plans

This directory contains agent plans that are no longer active but preserved for reference.

## Archived Files

### `drizzle-refactoring-plan.md`

- **Date:** 2025-01-09
- **Status:** Replaced by `direct-conversion-migration-plan.md`
- **Reason:** Over-engineered parallel validation approach unsuitable for solo dev context
- **Context:** Written for production team scenario, not solo development pre-beta phase

### `migration-refactoring-plan.md`

- **Date:** Earlier iteration
- **Status:** Superseded by direct conversion approach
- **Reason:** Also focused on parallel validation and complex infrastructure
- **Context:** Production-oriented migration strategy

## Why These Were Archived

**Context Changed:** Discovery that PinPoint is in solo development, pre-beta phase with:

- No production users
- No deployment constraints
- High risk tolerance
- Need for velocity over safety

**Approach Changed:** From parallel validation (complex, slow) to direct conversion (simple, fast):

- Parallel validation: 7+ weeks with complex infrastructure
- Direct conversion: 2-3 weeks with clean implementations

**New Plan:** `../direct-conversion-migration-plan.md` reflects the appropriate strategy for the actual project context.

**Note:** These plans contain valuable technical analysis and may be useful for reference, but should not be executed in the current project context.
