# Teams Agent Prompt Template

> **Merged**: The teams-specific template has been merged into the main `agent-prompt-template.md`.
> See the "For Agent Teams Teammates" section at the bottom of that file for the additional fields.
>
> Built-in Agent Teams now handles context injection via CLAUDE.md and spawn prompts,
> so a separate template is no longer necessary.
