/**
 * Test Seed Data Architecture - Hardcoded IDs for Consistency & Predictability
 *
 * This file defines the foundation of our test data architecture using hardcoded,
 * predictable IDs instead of random generation. This approach provides:
 * - Consistent test data across all environments (CI, local, pgTAP)
 * - Predictable debugging ("why is machine-mm-001 failing?")
 * - Stable foreign key relationships
 * - No flaky tests from nanoid() randomness
 *
 * ## Architecture: Minimal â†’ Full Progression
 *
 * Our seed data follows an additive pattern:
 * 1. **Minimal Seed**: Foundation dataset (~10 machines, 20 issues, 2 orgs)
 *    - Used for: Development, CI, most integration tests
 *    - Fast performance, essential relationships only
 *
 * 2. **Full Seed**: Minimal + additional data (~60 machines, 200+ issues)
 *    - Used for: Preview environments, comprehensive testing
 *    - Builds on minimal foundation, never replaces it
 *
 * ## Two-Organization RLS Testing
 *
 * Includes two organizations to enable proper security boundary testing:
 * - PRIMARY: "test-org-pinpoint" (Austin Pinball Collective)
 * - COMPETITOR: "test-org-competitor" (Competitor Arcade)
 *
 * ## Usage Patterns
 *
 * **TypeScript Unit Tests**: Use SEED_TEST_IDS.MOCK_PATTERNS
 * ```typescript
 * const mockContext = { organizationId: SEED_TEST_IDS.MOCK_PATTERNS.ORGANIZATION };
 * ```
 *
 * **Integration Tests**: Use direct static constants
 * ```typescript
 * const machineId = SEED_TEST_IDS.MACHINES.MEDIEVAL_MADNESS_1;
 * const priorityId = SEED_TEST_IDS.PRIORITIES.HIGH;
 * ```
 *
 * **SQL/pgTAP Tests**: Use generated SQL functions
 * ```sql
 * -- Generated via: npm run generate:sql-constants
 * SELECT results_eq(
 *   'SELECT organization_id FROM issues WHERE id = test_issue_primary()',
 *   'SELECT test_org_primary()',
 *   'Issue belongs to correct organization'
 * );
 * ```
 *
 * **Multi-Org Security Tests**: Use both organizations
 * ```typescript
 * // Create data in org-1, verify org-2 cannot access
 * await setOrgContext(db, SEED_TEST_IDS.ORGANIZATIONS.primary);
 * await setOrgContext(db, SEED_TEST_IDS.ORGANIZATIONS.competitor);
 * ```
 *
 * ## Generated Artifacts
 *
 * This file serves as the source of truth for:
 * - TypeScript constants (direct import)
 * - SQL constants (via generate-sql-constants.ts)
 * - Seed script IDs (replaces nanoid() calls)
 *
 * ## Related Files
 *
 * - scripts/seed/shared/infrastructure.ts - Uses these IDs for seeding
 * - scripts/seed/shared/sample-data.ts - Uses these IDs for sample data
 * - scripts/generate-sql-constants.ts - Generates pgTAP SQL functions
 * - supabase/tests/constants.sql - Generated SQL constants (DO NOT EDIT)
