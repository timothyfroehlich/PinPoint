/**
 * E2E – Member Issue Creation – Test Skeleton (Playwright)
 *
 * Covers end-to-end member flow: navigate to /issues/create, submit a valid
 * form, see success; verifies validation errors and visibility for private
 * locations as a member.
 *
 * Use:
 * - Stable data-testids from the UI Spec in docs/feature_specs/issue-creation.md
 * - Seed org/user session helpers (login fixtures) if available; otherwise mock auth
 * - SEED_TEST_IDS for deterministic machine choices when necessary
