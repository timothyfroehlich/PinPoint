# PinPoint Development Instructions

## 🚨 MANDATORY: USE CONTEXT7 EXTENSIVELY 🚨

**CRITICAL DIRECTIVE:** Always use Context7 for current library documentation when:

- Working with any library/framework (Drizzle, Supabase, Next.js, Material UI, Vitest, etc.)
- Your knowledge might be outdated (training cutoff January 2025, now August 2025)
- Looking up API changes, new features, or current best practices
- Need examples of modern patterns and implementation approaches

**Process:** `resolve-library-id` → `get-library-docs` → Apply current patterns
**Why:** Libraries evolve rapidly, my training is 7+ months behind critical updates

## Project Context & Development Phase

**CRITICAL CONTEXT**: This is a **solo development project in pre-beta phase**:

- **No users**: Zero production users or real-world usage
- **No production environment**: Still in development/framework building phase
- **Team of 1**: Solo developer, no coordination or migration concerns for others
- **Pre-beta**: Core features and navigation still being decided
- **High risk tolerance**: Breaking things temporarily is completely acceptable
- **E2E tests mostly disabled**: UI/UX still in flux, comprehensive testing not yet needed

**Impact on Technical Decisions**:

- Optimize for **velocity and learning** over production safety
- **Move fast and break things** is the appropriate approach
- Don't over-engineer solutions for problems that don't exist in this context
- Parallel validation, complex migration infrastructure, and extensive safety measures are **waste** in this phase
- Direct conversion approaches are preferred - cleanup issues as they arise

### 🚨 CRITICAL: Post-Training Breaking Changes

**🔥 IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED:** `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` DEPRECATED → causes auth loops

## Claude Memories

- Don't be a yes-man and don't pander to me
- Don't leave references to old/removed things in documentation
- Your training ended in 2024. It's July 2025 now. Don't hesitate to look up the latest documentation if you suspect you're out of date
- We use husky for precommits and preuploads
- We run shellcheck against our scripts

## 🚨🚨🚨 CRITICAL COMMAND RESTRICTIONS 🚨🚨🚨

### ⛔ ABSOLUTELY FORBIDDEN: npm test with Redirection

**🔥 NEVER EVER USE THESE COMMANDS 🔥**

```bash
npm test 2>&1          # ❌ BREAKS VITEST
npm test > file.txt    # ❌ BREAKS VITEST
npm test >> file.txt   # ❌ BREAKS VITEST
npm run test:* 2>&1    # ❌ BREAKS VITEST
vitest 2>&1            # ❌ BREAKS VITEST
```

**💥 WHY THIS BREAKS EVERYTHING:**

- Vitest interprets `2>&1`, `>`, `>>` as **test name filters**
- Instead of redirecting output, Vitest searches for tests matching "2>&1"
- This causes bizarre test behavior and broken output
- **NO REDIRECTION WORKS** with Vitest CLI commands

**✅ USE THESE INSTEAD:**

```bash
npm run test:brief     # ✅ Fast, minimal output
npm run test:quiet     # ✅ Suppress console logs
npm run test:verbose   # ✅ Detailed output
npm run test:coverage  # ✅ With coverage report
```

### ⛔ Other Command Restrictions

- **NEVER use the `find` command** - it's dangerous due to the `-exec` flag which can execute arbitrary commands

### ✅ Safe Command Alternatives

- **ripgrep (rg)** - for content searching: `rg --files | rg "pattern"`, `rg -l "content" --type js`
- **fd/fdfind** - for file discovery: `fd "*.js"`, `fd --type f --changed-within 1day`
- **git ls-files** - for repo files: `git ls-files | grep "\.js$"`
- Prefer rg (ripgrep) to find or grep
- Install missing tools with `brew` (preferred) or `apt`
