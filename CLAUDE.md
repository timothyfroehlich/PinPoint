# PinPoint Development Instructions

## üö® ACTIVE MIGRATION: Supabase + Drizzle + RLS

**Status**: IN PROGRESS - Week 4 of 6

- **Stage 1** (Weeks 1-2): Supabase Auth integration ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- **Stage 2** (Weeks 3-4): Drizzle ORM migration
  - Phase 2A: Drizzle Foundation ‚úÖ COMPLETE (2025-08-02)
  - Phase 2B-E: Router Migrations üîÑ IN PROGRESS
- **Stage 3** (Weeks 5-6): Row Level Security activation

**Migration Hub**: `@docs/migration/supabase-drizzle/`

### ‚úÖ Phase 2A Achievements

- Complete Drizzle schema with 1:1 Prisma parity
- Dual-ORM support in tRPC context
- 39 comprehensive tests validating foundation
- Essential multi-tenant performance indexes
- Hot-reload optimization with singleton pattern

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Supabase Configuration Notes

**Performance Optimizations**: The following Supabase features are currently disabled in `supabase/config.toml` for development performance:

- `db.migrations` - Disabled during development phase
- `realtime` - Disabled for performance
- `studio` - Disabled for performance

**üîî REMINDER**: Re-enable these features in `supabase/config.toml` when ready for beta:

```toml
[db.migrations]
enabled = true  # Re-enable for production migrations

[realtime]
enabled = true  # Re-enable for real-time features

[studio]
enabled = true  # Re-enable for database management UI
```

## üö® DATABASE SCHEMA COORDINATION WARNING

**CRITICAL**: PinPoint uses a **SINGLE SHARED** local Supabase instance across all worktrees.

**‚ö†Ô∏è BEFORE making database schema changes:**

- **Check other worktrees**: Coordinate with any other development work
- **Announce changes**: Let Tim know if you're about to modify schema
- **Consider impact**: Schema changes affect ALL active worktrees immediately
- **Test thoroughly**: Changes cannot be isolated to single worktree

**üîß Safe Development Pattern:**

1. Check active worktrees: `./scripts/list-worktrees.sh`
2. Announce schema change intention
3. Make changes in ONE worktree only
4. Test across all affected worktrees
5. Update other developers if working collaboratively

**üóÉÔ∏è Database Architecture:**

- **Local Development**: Single shared Supabase instance (ports 54321-54324)
- **All Worktrees**: Connect to same local database
- **Schema Changes**: Immediately visible across all worktrees
- **Data Changes**: Shared across all local development work

## Tech Stack (TRANSITIONING)

### Current Stack (Being Replaced)

- **Database**: PostgreSQL + Prisma ORM ‚Üí **Drizzle ORM**
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js ‚Üí **Supabase Auth**
- **Authorization**: App-level checks ‚Üí **Row Level Security**
- **File Storage**: Local/Vercel Blob ‚Üí **Supabase Storage**

### Stable Stack (Unchanged)

- **Framework**: Next.js + React + TypeScript
- **UI**: Material UI (MUI)
- **API**: tRPC (exclusive - no custom API routes)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (with Supabase cloud services)

## Core Architecture

### API Strategy

PinPoint uses **tRPC exclusively** for all application endpoints. Traditional API routes are only used for:

- Authentication handlers (NextAuth requirement)
- Health checks (monitoring requirement)
- QR code redirects (HTTP redirect requirement)
- Development utilities (dev environment only)

See `docs/architecture/api-routes.md` for details on legitimate exceptions.

### Multi-Tenancy

- Shared database with row-level security
- All tenant tables require non-nullable `organization_id`
- Strict query scoping by `organization_id`
- Global users with organization-specific memberships

### Key Entities

- **Organization**: Top-level tenant (e.g., "Austin Pinball Collective")
- **Location**: Physical venue belonging to an Organization
- **Model**: Generic machine model (e.g., "Godzilla Premium")
- **Machine**: Specific physical machine at a Location
- **Issue**: Problem/task for a Game Instance
- **User**: Global account; **Member**: User + Organization + Role

## Essential Commands

```bash
# Development (RECOMMENDED)
npm run dev:bg          # Start dev server in background
npm run dev:bg:stop     # Stop background server
npm run dev:bg:status   # Check server status
npm run dev:bg:logs     # View server logs
npm run dev:clean       # Fresh start with cleanup
npm run setup:worktree  # Setup new worktree environment

# Validation Protocol (MANDATORY)
npm run check        # Development checks (typecheck + lint + format + audit)
npm run check:fix    # Development checks + auto-fix (after code changes)
npm run validate     # Pre-commit validation (MUST PASS)
npm run pre-commit   # Pre-PR validation (MUST PASS)

# Database
npm run db:reset
npm run db:push

# Database Inspection (Efficient - DON'T USE PRISMA STUDIO)
# Read schema structure: prisma/schema.prisma
# Query data samples directly (no GUI needed):
npx prisma db execute --stdin <<< "SELECT * FROM \"Organization\" LIMIT 5;"
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM \"User\";"
# DON'T launch Prisma Studio unless debugging specific data issues

# Core Commands (Use brief versions unless debugging)
# PREFERRED: Use :brief variants for daily development - faster, cleaner output
npm run typecheck:brief # TypeScript type checking (minimal output)
npm run lint:brief      # ESLint linting (quiet mode)
npm run format:brief    # Prettier formatting check (minimal output)
npm run audit:brief     # npm security vulnerability check (table format)
npm run test:brief      # Vitest unit tests (basic reporter)
npm run playwright:brief # E2E tests (line reporter, headless)
npm run smoke            # Smoke test (complete workflow validation)

# Regular versions - use only when brief fails and you need more detail
npm run typecheck       # Full TypeScript output
npm run lint            # Full ESLint output
npm run format          # Full Prettier output
npm run audit           # Full vulnerability details
npm run test            # Full Vitest output
npm run playwright      # Full E2E output

# Verbose versions - use sparingly, preferably with filters
# Only use when regular versions don't provide enough diagnostic info
npm run lint:verbose    # Detailed ESLint diagnostics
npm run typecheck:verbose # TypeScript with file lists

# Meta Commands
npm run check:brief     # PREFERRED: Fast validation (all brief variants)
npm run check           # Full validation when brief shows issues
npm run check:fix       # Validation with auto-fix
npm run fix             # Auto-fix lint + format issues

# Test Command Guidelines
# CRITICAL: Never pass shell redirection operators (2>&1, |, >, etc.) through npm's -- argument separator
# Shell operations must be outside the npm command
# ‚úÖ CORRECT: npm run test 2>&1 | head -50
# ‚ùå WRONG: npm run test -- --run 2>&1 | head -50
# If you need extra test arguments beyond filtering, ask the user first

# TypeScript Error Filtering
npm run typecheck                                 # Check entire project (recommended)
npm run typecheck | grep "pattern"               # Filter errors by pattern
npm run typecheck | head -10                     # Show first 10 errors
npm run typecheck | grep "usePermissions"        # Find specific function errors
```

## TypeScript Standards

**Complete Reference**: See `@docs/quick-reference/typescript-strictest-patterns.md` (auto-loaded) for patterns and error solutions.

### Multi-Config Strategy

- **Production Code** (`tsconfig.json`): `@tsconfig/strictest` - zero tolerance for errors
- **Test Utilities** (`tsconfig.test-utils.json`): `@tsconfig/recommended` - moderate standards
- **Test Files** (`tsconfig.tests.json`): Relaxed - pragmatic patterns allowed

### Config-Specific Commands

- **Production errors**: Always block CI/commits
- **Test utility warnings**: Reported but non-blocking
- **Test file issues**: Ignored for pragmatic testing

## Development Workflow

1. **Start**: `npm run validate` ‚Üí `npm run dev:bg`
2. **During**: Run `npm run check` after significant code changes
3. **Before commit**: `npm run validate` must pass (MANDATORY)
4. **Before PR**: `npm run pre-commit` must pass (MANDATORY)
5. **Database changes**: Use `npm run db:reset` (pre-production phase)

### Environment Configuration

- **Shared Database**: All worktrees use a single shared development database configured via Vercel environment variables
- **Environment Setup**: Worktree setup uses `vercel env pull` to sync shared environment variables

### Agent Protocol Benefits

- **Context preservation**: ~3-5 lines output vs 100+ lines
- **Auto-fix capability**: Automatically fixes lint/format issues
- **Early detection**: Catch issues during development, not CI
- **Consistent format**: ‚úì Success messages, ‚úó Error summaries

## Architecture Principles

- **TypeScript First**: Strict typing, no unsafe operations
- **Optimistic UI**: Immediate updates, background API calls, revert on failure
- **Future-Ready**: Design for Kanban board (post-1.0) and inventory (v2.0)
- **Testing**: ~~Unit tests with mocked dependencies only~~ ‚Üí **Integration-first with transactions**

## MCP Tools Available

- **GitHub**: Repository management, PRs, issues
- **Playwright**: Browser automation, E2E testing
- **Context7**: Library documentation lookup
- **Memory**: Knowledge graph for storing and retrieving coding patterns

### Agent Planning System

**Directory**: `.claude/agent-plans/` (gitignored - transient work files)

**Purpose**: Agents should create detailed planning documents before starting complex implementation work. This ensures thorough analysis and provides a clear roadmap for execution.

**When to Use**:

- Complex migrations or refactoring tasks
- Multi-step implementation requiring coordination
- Schema changes or architectural modifications
- Any task that benefits from detailed upfront planning

**Required Agent Workflow**:

1. **Check for existing plans**: Always read any existing files in `.claude/agent-plans/` when starting work
2. **Create planning documents**: Write comprehensive analysis and implementation plans before coding
3. **Document decisions**: Record architectural choices, trade-offs, and rationale
4. **Update progress**: Maintain plans as living documents throughout implementation

**Example Planning Documents**:

- `phase-2a-drizzle-schema-analysis.md` - Detailed schema migration analysis
- `database-connection-strategy.md` - Database integration approach
- `type-migration-plan.md` - TypeScript type compatibility strategy

### Memory Server Usage

The Memory MCP server stores critical coding standards and patterns as a knowledge graph. Use for complex pattern lookup beyond the auto-loaded quick references.

Quick commands:

- `mcp__memory__search_nodes` - Search for patterns by keyword
- `mcp__memory__open_nodes` - Get specific entity details
- `mcp__memory__read_graph` - See all stored knowledge

## Test-Architect Agent Usage

The test-architect agent specializes in improving individual test files. It's self-directed and will discover necessary context.

### When to Use

- Writing new tests
- Fixing failing tests
- Improving test quality (fragility, performance, coverage)
- Modernizing old test patterns

### Workflow

1. **Single File Assignment**: Always assign one test file at a time
2. **Self-Discovery**: Agent will find and read relevant docs/examples
3. **Recommendations**: If agent returns improvement recommendations:
   ```
   Agent: { type: "test-improvement-recommendation", ... }
   You: Present recommendation to user with clear justification
   User: Approves/Declines
   You: If approved, implement then re-run agent with context
        If declined, re-run agent with "skip: [specific recommendation]"
   ```
4. **Completion**: Summarize what the agent accomplished

### Example Interaction

```
User: "Fix the tests in src/components/issues/__tests__/IssueCard.test.tsx"

You: "I'll use the test-architect agent to analyze and improve the IssueCard tests."

[Agent discovers it's a component test, reads relevant docs, identifies fragile patterns]

[If recommendation]: "The test-architect identified an opportunity to create a shared
issue test data factory that would benefit 6 test files. Should I implement this?"

[On completion]: "Test improvements complete:
- Replaced 12 fragile text assertions with semantic queries
- Removed 2 unnecessary mocks (now testing real components)
- Added auth scenario testing (unauthenticated, member, admin)
- All 8 tests passing, 40% faster execution"
```

### Recommendation Handling Example

```
User: "Fix the IssueCard tests"

You: "I'll use the test-architect agent to improve those tests."

[Test-architect returns recommendation about creating shared test factory]

You: "The test-architect discovered an improvement opportunity before completing the test fixes. It found 6 test files using similar issue mock data and recommends creating a shared test factory. This would:
- Reduce ~120 lines of duplicate code
- Provide a single source of truth for issue test data
- Make future test updates easier

Should I implement this improvement first?"

User: "Yes, go ahead"

You: [Implement the test factory]
You: "I've created the shared test factory. Now I'll have the test-architect complete the IssueCard test improvements using this new utility."

[Call test-architect again, it will now use the new factory]

--- OR ---

User: "No, just fix the tests as-is"

You: "Understood. I'll have the test-architect complete the test fixes without creating the shared factory."

[Call test-architect with: "Continue with IssueCard.test.tsx improvements. Skip creating the issue test factory - user prefers to keep current pattern."]
```

### Logging and Audit Trail

**CRITICAL: Always check the log file after each test-architect run**

The test-architect agent creates detailed logs at `.claude/sub-agent-logs/test-architect-{timestamp}.log`:

- Every file read during context gathering
- Analysis findings and decision points
- All transformations applied with before/after examples
- Validation results (test runs, lint, typecheck)
- Any errors encountered and their resolutions
- Final completion summary

**Workflow requirement**: After each agent run, read the log file to:

1. Verify all expected actions were completed
2. Review any issues or errors encountered
3. Understand what context files were examined
4. Confirm test results and validations

### Map Maintenance

The test-architect will update `test-map.md` and `source-map.md` as it works. These maps may be outdated, so the agent uses them as guides, not gospel.

## Agent Work Review Protocol

**MANDATORY**: After any agent completes work that modifies code or creates files, you MUST:

### 1. Immediate Review Checklist

- ‚úÖ **Check git status**: `git status --porcelain` to see all modified/created files
- ‚úÖ **Review each change**: Use `git diff` to examine modifications
- ‚úÖ **Validate file creation**: Ensure any new files were authorized
- ‚úÖ **Check scope compliance**: Verify agent stayed within assigned task boundaries

### 2. Quality Validation

- ‚úÖ **Run validation**: `npm run typecheck:brief && npm run lint:brief`
- ‚úÖ **Test impact**: Run relevant tests to ensure no regressions
- ‚úÖ **Business logic**: Verify functional requirements were preserved
- ‚úÖ **Security patterns**: Confirm multi-tenant isolation and permission checks

### 3. Rule Compliance Check

- ‚úÖ **Documentation policy**: Agents should NOT create .md files without explicit permission
- ‚úÖ **Scope boundaries**: Agents should only modify files within their assigned domain
- ‚úÖ **Project guidelines**: All changes must follow established patterns and standards

### 4. Agent Accountability

- ‚úÖ **Task completion**: Verify agent accomplished the assigned objective
- ‚úÖ **Quality standards**: Check that work meets production quality requirements
- ‚úÖ **Boundary respect**: Ensure agent didn't exceed authorized scope

**If Issues Found**: Document the problem, update agent instructions to prevent recurrence, and decide whether to keep, modify, or revert the agent's work.

**Agent Domains**:

- **drizzle-migration**: Router file migration (implementation only)
- **test-architect**: Test files and test infrastructure (NO documentation creation)
- **github-pr-reviewer**: PR analysis and review comments
- **typescript-lint-fixer**: Type errors and lint violations

## Migration Best Practices

### During Migration

- **Parallel Development**: Both old and new patterns coexist temporarily
- **Feature Flags**: Use environment variables to toggle between implementations
- **Incremental Updates**: Update one service/component at a time
- **Test Both Paths**: Ensure tests cover both legacy and new code paths

### PR Requirements During Migration

- **Documentation Updates MANDATORY**: All PRs created during the Supabase + Drizzle + RLS migration MUST include documentation updates
- **Update Migration Docs**: Changes must be reflected in `@docs/migration/supabase-drizzle/` documentation
- **Environment Variable Changes**: Document any new or modified environment variables
- **Pattern Updates**: Update quick reference guides for new patterns or deprecated approaches
- **Migration Progress Tracking**: Update implementation status and lessons learned

### Database Commands (Migration Period)

```bash
# Prisma (current)
npm run db:push         # Schema sync
npm run db:reset        # Full reset

# Drizzle (migration target)
npm run drizzle:push    # Coming in Stage 2
npm run drizzle:migrate # Coming in Stage 2
```

## Critical Notes

- **Active Migration**: Supabase + Drizzle + RLS migration in progress
- Database strategy: Shared dev database, frequent resets during migration
- **Testing Evolution**: Moving from mock-heavy to transaction-based integration tests
- **Security Evolution**: App-level ‚Üí Database-level (RLS) enforcement
- Pre-production: frequent schema changes, no migrations
- OPDB games: global (no organizationId), custom games: organization-scoped
- **ESM modules**: Native ESM support throughout
- **Type Safety**: 100% strictest TypeScript in production code
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest with 7-65x performance over Jest

## Frontend Development Notes

- **MUI Version**: Currently using MUI v7.2.0 - always check Context7 for latest MUI documentation before making changes
- **Grid Components**: In MUI v7, use `import Grid from "@mui/material/Grid"` and `size={{ xs: 12, lg: 8 }}` syntax (no `item` prop needed)

## Development Practices

- **Server Status Checks**: ALWAYS use `npm run dev:bg:status` to check if the development server is running. NEVER use curl commands for server status checks.
- **ESLint Disabling**: NEVER add an eslint-disable unless you have exhausted all other options and confirmed with the user that it is the correct thing to do.
- **E2E Testing**: Use `npm run playwright` (headless). NEVER use `playwright:headed` or `playwright:ui` as they show browser windows and interrupt the user's workflow.
- **Smoke Testing**: Use `npm run smoke` for quick end-to-end workflow validation. This tests the complete issue creation ‚Üí admin management flow in ~2 minutes.
- **Prisma Studio**: AVOID launching Prisma Studio (`npm run db:studio`) unless absolutely necessary for debugging complex data issues. Use direct SQL queries, schema file reading, or existing component inspection instead.
- **Import Path Consistency**: ALWAYS use the TypeScript path alias `~/` for internal imports. NEVER use relative paths like `../../../lib/supabase/client`. ESLint enforces this with `no-restricted-imports` rule to prevent deep relative imports.

## Key Lessons Learned (Project-Specific)

**Complete Reference**: See `@docs/lessons-learned/INDEX.md` for comprehensive insights and counter-intuitive discoveries.

### Critical Project Insights

- **Shared database coordination**: Single Supabase instance across worktrees requires careful schema change coordination
- **Migration staged approach works**: 6-week phased migration (Auth ‚Üí Drizzle ‚Üí RLS) preventing big-bang failures
- **Import path consistency prevents cascade failures**: TypeScript alias enforcement (`~/`) essential for migration stability
- **Multi-config TypeScript complexity**: 4-tier setup requires careful agent guidance but provides precise control

## Claude Memories

- Don't be a yes-man and don't pander to me
- Don't leave references to old/removed things in documentation
- Your training ended in 2024. It's July 2025 now. Don't hesitate to look up the latest documentation if you suspect you're out of date
