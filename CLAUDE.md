# PinPoint Development Instructions (Claude Code)

@AGENTS.md

## Claude Code-Specific

### Context7 MCP Integration

- **When**: Working with libraries (Drizzle, Supabase, Next.js, shadcn/ui, Vitest)
- **Process**: `resolve-library-id` → `get-library-docs` → Apply current patterns

### Specialized Subagents

- **enforcer** - Code review with XML-guided workflows
- **investigator** - Deep read-only analysis and diagnostics
- **Explore** - Fast codebase exploration and search

### Working Style

- If you've spent more than 3 tool calls on environment setup without reproducing
  the actual issue, stop and ask the user for guidance.
- For simple PRs (< 5 files changed), do not spawn more than 2 sub-agents.
- Do not over-engineer or spawn excessive parallel agents for straightforward tasks.
