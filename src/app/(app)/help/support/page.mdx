## Austin Pinball Collective

PinPoint is built for Austin Pinball Collective (APC). If you have questions about machines, events, or membership, send a message to the PinPoint channel on the APC Discord.

## PinPoint Feedback

Found a bug in PinPoint itself, or have a feature suggestion? Use the feedback button in the bottom-right corner of any page to let us know. Your feedback goes directly to the development team.

## Something Looks Wrong?

If you see a missing machine, duplicate issues, or something that doesn't match reality, send a message to the PinPoint channel on the APC Discord. Admins and operators can correct machine data, merge or close issues, or adjust severities as needed.
