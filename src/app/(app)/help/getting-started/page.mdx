## What is PinPoint?

PinPoint is the issue tracker for **Austin Pinball Collective**. Report broken machines, track repairs, and see which games are playable — all in one place. Whether you're a regular player or just visiting, PinPoint helps keep the machines in great shape.

## Quick Tour

Here are the main sections you'll use:

- **Dashboard** — A snapshot of machine health and recent issues across the collection. Start here to see what's happening.
- **Machines** — Browse every machine in the collection. Each page shows its description, current status, open issues, and repair history.
- **Issues** — See all reported problems and their progress — from newly filed to resolved. Filter by status, machine, or priority.
- **Report** — File a new issue when something's wrong. [Open the report form](/report) to get started.

## Your First Report

See a broken flipper or a loose part? Report it so the team can fix it. Pick the machine, describe the problem, and submit — it only takes a minute. Your report helps the team prioritize repairs and keep games playable for everyone.

## Accounts & Roles

You can report issues without an account — just use the report form as a guest. If you sign up, you'll be able to track your reports, receive notifications when issues are updated, and watch specific machines for new problems.

PinPoint has several roles — **Guest**, **Member**, and **Admin** — each with different permissions.
