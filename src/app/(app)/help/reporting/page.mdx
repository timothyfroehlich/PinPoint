## How to Report an Issue

1. Go to the [Report Issue](/report) page
2. Select the machine you are standing at
3. Give the issue a short, clear title
4. Describe what you saw — what happened, which shot, etc.
5. Choose a severity (how it affects play) and frequency (how often it happens)
6. (Optional) Provide your name and email if you want to be notified about the fix
7. Submit the report

## Severity Levels

Severity describes how much the issue affects gameplay:

- **Cosmetic** — very minor issues that do not affect gameplay at all (dirty playfield, minor bulb out)
- **Minor** — small issues with minor effects on gameplay, like a bumper that won't trigger or a flipper that's feeling weak
- **Major** — the game plays, but something significant is wrong (shots not registering, slingshots won't fire, etc.)
- **Unplayable** — the game should be treated as down (loose part, flippers dead, game will not start)

## Frequency

Frequency describes how often the problem happens:

- **Intermittent** — happens sometimes, but not every time (e.g., a ball occasionally gets stuck)
- **Frequent** — happens often during a game
- **Constant** — happens every game, including broken or loose parts

## Tips for a Good Report

- Use a specific title (**"Left flipper dead on Medieval Madness"** not **"broken"**)
- Say which shot or feature is affected
- Note if the problem just started or has been ongoing
- Add photos if you can — they help techs understand the problem faster

## What Happens After You Report

- The issue appears on the dashboard for members and operators
- A tech can assign the issue to themselves or another member and update its status as they work
- Comments can be added to track troubleshooting steps and fixes
- If you provided your contact info, you'll be notified when the issue is updated or resolved
