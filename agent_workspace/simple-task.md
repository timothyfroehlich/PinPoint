# Simple Task: Test the Dispatcher

## Mission Statement
Validate that the generic SUBAGENT_TASK.md dispatcher correctly routes agents to this fallback task file.

## Context
This is a test task to ensure the dispatcher fallback mechanism works correctly when no agent-type-specific task file is found.

## Implementation Steps
1. Confirm you found this file via the SUBAGENT_TASK.md dispatcher
2. List all available task files in the agent_workspace directory
3. Verify the dispatcher logic works as expected
4. Report back your findings

## Quality Requirements
- Document the file discovery process
- Confirm the dispatcher routing worked correctly

## Success Criteria
- Agent successfully found this file through the dispatcher
- File discovery logic worked as documented
- Fallback mechanism is functional

## Completion Instructions
Report that the generic dispatcher test was successful and the fallback mechanism works.
