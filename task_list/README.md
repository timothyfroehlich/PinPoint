# PinPoint Task List - Roles & Permissions Implementation

## Task Status Summary

### âœ… Completed Tasks (4/8)
- **Task 001**: Remove insecure /api/issues API routes
- **Task 002**: Remove unused /api/upload routes  
- **Task 003**: Audit tRPC procedures for permission coverage
- **Task 004**: Complete issue detail page implementation

### ðŸ“‹ Pending Tasks (4/8)
- **Task 005**: Implement permission-based UI components (Note: Actually completed, needs verification)
- **Task 006**: Create E2E tests for permission scenarios
- **Task 007**: Update documentation for API changes (Note: Actually completed in this session)
- **Task 008**: Full system validation and testing

### ðŸ§ª Additional Unit Test Tasks (Created separately)
- **UNIT-TEST-001 to 008**: Comprehensive unit test coverage for permission system

## Primary Objectives

### 1. Complete Roles and Permissions Implementation

The roles and permissions system is partially implemented but needs to be completed across all areas of the application. This includes:

- Ensuring all tRPC procedures have proper permission checks
- Completing the permission system integration in all UI components
- Implementing role-based access control for all features
- Testing the permission system thoroughly

### 2. Finish the Issue Detail Page

The issue detail page needs to be completed with full permission integration:

- Display issue details with proper permission checks
- Enable editing only for users with appropriate permissions
- Implement status updates with permission validation
- Add comment functionality with proper access control
- Integrate file attachments with permission checks

## Current State

- **Permissions System**: Core implementation exists in `src/lib/permissions/`
- **tRPC Integration**: Permission checks are implemented in some procedures but not all
- **UI Components**: Some components check permissions, others need updates
- **Issue Detail Page**: Basic structure exists but needs completion

## Architecture Decisions

- **API Strategy**: Consolidating on tRPC for all API calls (removing REST API routes)
- **Permission Model**: Row-level security with organization-based multi-tenancy
- **UI Pattern**: Optimistic updates with permission pre-checks

## Task Organization

Each task file in this directory represents a specific work item. Tasks are organized by:

- **Security Critical**: Tasks that fix security vulnerabilities
- **Core Implementation**: Tasks to complete the permission system
- **UI Integration**: Tasks to integrate permissions into UI components
- **Testing**: Tasks to ensure everything works correctly

## Important Development Notes

**Tests may not pass during implementation!** This is expected. Focus on:

1. **Linting first**: Ensure your changes pass `npm run lint`
2. **TypeScript compilation**: Use `npm run typecheck | grep "pattern"` to filter errors
3. **Incremental progress**: Build features step by step
4. **Manual testing**: Verify functionality works even if tests are failing

The final validation task (Task 008) is when all tests should be passing. Until then, focus on clean, linted code that compiles without TypeScript errors.
