# PinPoint Task Management

## 🚨 IMPORTANT: Task Lists Have Been Consolidated

**This directory has been reorganized. Please use the new consolidated resources:**

- **📋 Active Tasks**: See `CONSOLIDATED_TASK_LIST.md` in the repository root
- **📚 Lessons Learned**: See `docs/lessons-learned/task-completion-insights.md`
- **📁 Completed Tasks**: Archived in `docs/archive/completed-task-lists/`

## 🎉 Roles & Permissions Implementation Status: 75% Complete

### ✅ Completed (6/8 tasks)

1. ✓ Remove insecure API routes
2. ✓ Remove unused upload routes
3. ✓ Audit tRPC procedures for permission coverage
4. ✓ Complete issue detail page implementation
5. ✓ Implement permission-based UI components
6. ✓ Update documentation for API changes

### 📋 Remaining Critical Tasks (2/8)

- **Task 006**: Create E2E tests for permission scenarios (IN PROGRESS)
- **Task 008**: Full system validation and testing (PENDING)

- **📋 Current Work**: See remaining tasks in `006-TEST-e2e-permission-scenarios.md` and `008-VALIDATE-full-system-test.md`
- **🔄 Login Flow**: See `login-flow/` subdirectory for related authentication improvements
- **📖 Architecture**: Permission system implemented in `src/lib/permissions/`

## Migration Summary

**What Changed**:

- All individual completed task files moved to archive
- Lessons learned extracted to dedicated documentation
- All remaining work consolidated into single prioritized list
- Focus shifted to final validation and testing phase

**Why This Helps**:

- Single source of truth for remaining work
- Lessons learned preserved for future reference
- Reduced clutter and confusion
- Clear completion criteria established

## Development Context

**Current State**: Roles & permissions core implementation is complete

- ✅ Security foundation solid (API routes consolidated, permissions audited)
- ✅ UI components created and integrated
- ✅ Documentation updated and comprehensive
- 📋 Final testing and validation needed

**Next Steps**: Focus on the critical path to completion

1. Complete E2E permission scenario testing
2. Run full system validation
3. Prepare for production deployment
