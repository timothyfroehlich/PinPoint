# Completed Tasks Summary

## Security Tasks Completed ✅

### Task 001: Remove Insecure API Routes

**Completed**: Successfully removed all `/api/issues` routes that bypassed permissions

**What was done**:

- Deleted `src/app/api/issues/` directory entirely
- Removed test files for these routes
- Verified no references remain in codebase
- Updated E2E tests to remove API mocking

**Impact**: Eliminated critical security vulnerability where any authenticated user could access any organization's issues

### Task 002: Remove Unused Upload Routes

**Completed**: Successfully removed all unused `/api/upload` routes

**What was done**:

- Deleted `src/app/api/upload/` directory entirely
- Removed all three upload endpoints (generic, issue, organization-logo)
- Verified routes were only used in archived frontend code
- Confirmed tRPC supports multipart uploads for future needs

**Impact**: Removed potential security risk from upload endpoints that only checked authentication, not permissions

### Task 003: Audit tRPC Procedures for Permission Coverage

**Completed**: Comprehensive audit confirmed excellent permission coverage

**Key findings**:

- ✅ All tRPC routers properly implement permission checks
- ✅ Consistent use of permission-specific procedures:
  - `organizationProcedure` - ensures organization membership
  - `issueEditProcedure`, `machineEditProcedure`, etc. - specific permissions
  - `organizationManageProcedure` - admin operations
- ✅ No security gaps found
- ✅ Multi-tenant isolation properly enforced

**Routers audited**:

- Issue router (core, comments, attachments) - Full permission coverage
- Organization router - Properly protected
- Location router - All mutations protected
- Machine router - Appropriate permissions
- User router - Personal & admin operations separated
- Collection router - Public reads, protected writes

## Remaining API Routes (Legitimate)

The following API routes remain and are documented as legitimate:

1. `/api/auth/[...nextauth]` - Required by NextAuth.js
2. `/api/trpc/[trpc]` - tRPC handler endpoint
3. `/api/health` - Health check for monitoring
4. `/api/qr/[qrCodeId]` - QR code HTTP redirects
5. `/api/dev/users` - Development utility (404 in production)

## Security Posture

**Before**: Mixed API strategy with security vulnerabilities

- API routes bypassed permission system
- Any authenticated user could access any data
- Inconsistent authorization patterns

**After**: Secure tRPC-only strategy

- All business logic uses tRPC with type safety
- Complete permission coverage on all procedures
- Consistent authorization patterns
- Multi-tenant isolation enforced
- Only necessary API routes remain (auth, health, etc.)

### Task 004: Complete Issue Detail Page Implementation

**Completed**: Successfully implemented full-featured issue detail page with permissions

**What was done**:

- Created server component with SEO metadata at `src/app/issues/[issueId]/page.tsx`
- Implemented all required client components:
  - `IssueDetail.tsx` - Core issue information display
  - `IssueComments.tsx` - Public comment system
  - `IssueStatusControl.tsx` - Status management with permissions
  - `IssueActions.tsx` - Edit/close/assign buttons with permission gates
  - `IssueTimeline.tsx` - Activity history display
- Added comprehensive data-testid attributes for testing
- Integrated permission system with PermissionButton and PermissionGate components
- Implemented mobile-responsive design with separate layouts
- Added optimistic UI updates with proper error handling
- Created comprehensive test coverage

**Key features**:

- ✅ Full permission integration - all actions properly gated
- ✅ Public and authenticated views working correctly
- ✅ Mobile-first responsive design
- ✅ Accessibility with ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- ✅ Real-time updates using tRPC queries
- ✅ Type-safe implementation throughout

**Impact**: Users can now view issue details with appropriate permission-based controls, comment on issues, update status, and perform actions based on their role

## Next Steps

With the security foundation solid and issue detail page complete, the team can now focus on:

- Task 005: Creating reusable permission-based UI components
- Task 006: E2E testing for permissions
- Task 007: Documentation updates
- Task 008: Full system validation
