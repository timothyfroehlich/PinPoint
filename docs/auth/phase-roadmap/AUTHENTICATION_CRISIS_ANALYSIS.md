# Authentication Modernization Overview (Formerly "Authentication System Crisis Analysis")

**Original Crisis Status (Historical)**: Critical systemic failure (multiple competing auth patterns, race conditions, duplicate queries).

**Current Baseline**: Phase 1 (Consolidation) COMPLETE – single canonical resolver (`getRequestAuthContext`) + legacy adapters removed; Phase 1 snapshot stored in `docs/auth/phase1-snapshot.json` and completion doc `docs/auth/PHASE1_COMPLETION.md`.

This document now serves as a concise status & validation index for the remaining modernization phases defined in `docs/auth/phase-roadmap/INDEX.md`.

---

## 1. Background (Condensed)
The original crisis stemmed from 8+ divergent authentication entrypoints, function-name collisions (`requireOrganizationContext`), and widespread redundant resolver invocations across Server Components. This produced nondeterministic membership failures and inflated query counts (4–5x per request). Consolidation established a single deterministic layered resolver (Session → Identity → Org Context → Authorization) returning a discriminated union instead of throwing.

## 2. Phase Status Summary

| Phase | Title | Purpose (Focus) | Status | Exit Criteria (Key) |
|-------|-------|-----------------|--------|---------------------|
| 1 | Consolidation (Historical) | Single canonical resolver & adapter removal | ✅ Complete | Resolver is sole source of truth; legacy adapters removed |
| 2A | Request Context Core | Unified per-request context (ALS wrapper) | ⏳ Pending | `getRequestContext()` stable & reused server-wide |
| 2B | Observability & Errors | Structured logger + error taxonomy + timing wrapper | ⏳ Pending | All new errors mapped; logs auto include requestId |
| 3A | Permissions DSL | Declarative permission engine / action registry | ⏳ Pending | `can(ctx).perform(action).on(resource)` in use (pilot) |
| 3B | Permissions Migration | Replace legacy role checks with DSL | ⏳ Pending | ≥80% legacy checks removed; audit script near zero |
| 4A | Caching & Performance | Micro-TTL membership/org cache + negative cache | ⏳ Pending | Duplicate membership/org queries per request = 0; >50% hit ratio |
| 4B | Security & Policy Hardening | Boundary lint, RLS assertions, secret audit | ⏳ Pending | Lint rules enforced (error) & RLS helper adopted |
| 5 | Advanced Testing & Scenario Matrix | Scenario coverage & permission matrix snapshots | ⏳ Pending | Matrix test green; single-resolver test enforced |
| 6A | Feature Flags & Context Enrichment | Add flags/locale into context | ⏳ Pending | Flags accessible via `getFlag()`; locale present in context |
| 6B | Performance Telemetry | p50/p95 in-memory timing + slow-call warnings | ⏳ Pending | Perf endpoint shows samples; slow warning debounced |
| 7 | Cleanup & Finalization | Remove transition layers, finalize docs | ⏳ Pending | No transitional wrappers; final architecture doc committed |

Legend: ✅ Complete | ⏳ In Progress / Pending | 🚫 Blocked

## 3. Cross-Phase Traceability Matrix

| Remediation Goal | Achieved In | Verification Artifact / Future Phase |
|------------------|-------------|---------------------------------------|
| Single resolver only | Phase 1 | Snapshot JSON / lint ban persists |
| Eliminate duplicate auth calls | Phase 1 + 2A guard | Instrumentation + single-call test (Phase 5) |
| Central request context | Phase 2A | `request-context.ts` tests |
| Structured error mapping | Phase 2B | Error mapper tests / sample API route |
| Declarative permissions | 3A | Engine unit tests |
| Migration off role checks | 3B | Audit script report |
| Membership/org micro-cache | 4A | Hit/miss logs & reduced query counts |
| Security boundary lint | 4B | ESLint config & CI enforcement |
| Scenario + matrix tests | 5 | `permission-matrix.test.ts` snapshot |
| Feature flags & locale | 6A | Flag registry + context field present |
| Timing & percentiles | 6B | `/api/_internal/perf-stats` output |
| Transitional cleanup | 7 | Architecture final doc |

## 4. Final Validation Checklist (Executed After Phase 7)

All items must be ✅ for modernization to be declared fully complete.

| Category | Check | Method | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|
| Resolver Integrity | Only `getRequestAuthContext` resolves auth | Code search + lint rule | Pending |
| Request Context | `getRequestContext()` always available in server actions & routes | Unit & integration tests | Pending |
| Permission Enforcement | 100% critical paths use DSL (no direct role string compares) | Audit script output | Pending |
| Caching | Duplicate membership/org queries eliminated | Query instrumentation diff | Pending |
| Security Boundaries | No forbidden imports & RLS assertions executed | ESLint & spot logs | Pending |
| Performance | p95 auth + permission resolution time recorded & < baseline | Perf endpoint snapshot | Pending |
| Regression Guard | Single-auth-call test enforced in CI | Test suite result | Pending |
| Documentation | `ARCHITECTURE_FINAL.md` + this overview updated | Doc review | Pending |
| Cleanup | No transitional wrappers or legacy flags | Grep & lint | Pending |
| Observability | Structured error mapping + requestId in logs | Sample logs | Pending |

## 5. Metrics & Evidence to Capture Per Phase

| Phase | Primary Metric(s) | Capture Mechanism |
|-------|-------------------|-------------------|
| 2A | Context availability rate | Test harness assertions |
| 2B | % routes using structured errors | Grep + sample logs audit |
| 3A | Engine test coverage (# actions × roles) | Jest/Vitest report |
| 3B | Remaining legacy role checks | Audit script count |
| 4A | Cache hit ratio / duplicate query count | In-memory counters log |
| 4B | Boundary violation count | ESLint CI output |
| 5 | Scenario matrix completeness | Snapshot test diff |
| 6A | Flag resolution latency (ns/op) | micro benchmark (optional) |
| 6B | p50 / p95 durations (auth, permission) | Telemetry endpoint JSON |
| 7 | Transitional artifact count (should be 0) | Grep summary |

## 6. Risks & Preemptive Mitigations

| Risk | Phase | Mitigation |
|------|-------|------------|
| AsyncLocalStorage edge incompatibility | 2A | Provide fallback Map keyed by requestId header |
| Permission action proliferation | 3A | Namespaced actions + registry review gate |
| Cache staleness | 4A | Short TTL + bypass option for mutation paths |
| Over-aggressive lint blocking work | 4B | Introduce as warning; escalate to error post-migration |
| Snapshot test brittleness | 5 | Minimal deterministic JSON (action→allowed) |
| Performance overhead of telemetry | 6B | Sample & cap ring buffer size |

## 7. Historical Crisis Summary (Archive Extract)
Retained succinctly for context:
- 8+ competing auth entrypoints caused race conditions & query amplification.
- Function name collisions led to inconsistent cache keys.
- Multiple simultaneous resolver chains per request triggered nondeterministic membership failures.
- Consolidation (Phase 1) eliminated root structural causes.

Full original narrative & evidence preserved in version control history (earlier revisions of this file) and Phase 1 completion doc.

## 9. Execution Notes
Two-agent parallelization points intentionally embedded (A/B splits). If operating solo, follow numerical ordering but you may overlap 2A with 2B, then 3A with early 4A instrumentation planning.
