## Contents

### Testing Documentation (Deprecated August 2025)

- [`testing/`](./testing/) - Complete legacy testing documentation
  - All testing patterns, guides, and utilities from the pre-reboot system
  - Moved here during complete test system rebuild
  - Reference only - do not follow these patterns

## Status

**DEPRECATED**: All content in this directory is deprecated and should not be used for new development.

**Current Documentation**: See main docs directory for active documentation with the new archetype-based testing system.
