# Index of docs/lessons-learned

This directory contains documentation about lessons learned during the development of the PinPoint application. These documents capture insights, solutions to complex problems, and best practices derived from real-world development experiences.

**Note**: Core lessons learned have been integrated into the main `CLAUDE.md` file and testing documentation at `@docs/testing/vitest-best-practices.md` for easier agent reference.

- **[completed-task-consolidation.md](./completed-task-consolidation.md)**: Comprehensive lessons learned from task consolidation and cleanup across the PinPoint repository, covering task management best practices, technical implementation insights, and development process improvements. Captures counter-intuitive discoveries from security-first architecture, testing strategy evolution, and successful TypeScript/Vitest migrations.
- **[public-api-endpoints.md](./public-api-endpoints.md)**: Documents the implementation and validation of public API endpoints for unauthenticated access, covering security boundary testing, mock data accuracy challenges, and comprehensive test coverage strategies. Demonstrates counter-intuitive insights about multi-tenant scoping in public endpoints and the critical importance of mock data accuracy in testing.
- **[unified-dashboard-architecture.md](./unified-dashboard-architecture.md)**: Documents a comprehensive progressive enhancement architecture pattern for unified public/authenticated dashboards. Covers public-first design, graceful authentication flows, and modern React patterns for serving multiple user types on a single interface. Contains valuable architectural insights for applications with both public and authenticated user experiences.
- **[migration-reports/](./migration-reports/)**: Detailed Jest to Vitest migration reports from the completed framework migration. Contains performance benchmarks (18.5x overall improvement), established patterns like VitestMockContext and vi.hoisted(), and architecture insights discovered during authentication system migration. Valuable reference for understanding migration complexity and established testing patterns.
- **[typescript-migration-completed.md](./typescript-migration-completed.md)**: Documentation of the completed TypeScript migration from loose typing to strictest mode compliance. Captures the multi-tier configuration system, Betterer integration, development workflow changes, and lessons learned. All knowledge has been integrated into permanent developer guides.
