# Index of docs/architecture

This directory contains high-level documentation about the system architecture of PinPoint. It outlines the fundamental design choices and structural organization of the application.

- **[api-routes.md](./api-routes.md)**: This document details the project's API strategy, emphasizing the exclusive use of tRPC for all application endpoints. It also outlines the legitimate exceptions where traditional API routes are utilized, such as for authentication handlers, health checks, QR code redirects, and development utilities. This provides a clear understanding of how different types of API interactions are handled within the system.
- **[../authentication/environment-specific-auth.md](../authentication/environment-specific-auth.md)**: This document describes the environment-aware authentication system that provides different authentication methods and user seeding strategies based on deployment environment (development, preview, production). It covers OAuth validation, database seeding, test account management, and security considerations for each environment type.
- **[current-state.md](./current-state.md)**: This file provides an overview of the current architectural state of the PinPoint application. It describes the existing components, their interactions, and the overall structure as it stands. This document is crucial for understanding the baseline architecture before any new developments or refactorings.
- **[source-map.md](./source-map.md)**: This document offers a high-level map of the source code structure. It helps developers navigate the codebase by providing an overview of key directories, modules, and their relationships. This is particularly useful for new contributors to quickly grasp the layout of the project.
- **[terminology.md](./terminology.md)**: This file serves as a glossary of key terms and concepts used throughout the PinPoint project. It defines specific jargon, architectural patterns, and domain-specific language to ensure consistent understanding across the development team. This helps in reducing ambiguity and improving communication.
- **[test-map.md](./test-map.md)**: This document provides a map of the testing structure and its relation to the overall architecture. It outlines how different types of tests (unit, integration, E2E) are organized and how they cover various parts of the application. This ensures that testing efforts are aligned with the architectural design and that critical components are adequately covered.
