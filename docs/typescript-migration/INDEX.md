# Index of docs/typescript-migration

This directory contains documentation specifically related to the TypeScript migration efforts within the PinPoint project. It provides detailed plans, quick references, and checklists to guide developers through the process of adopting stricter TypeScript configurations and integrating tools like Betterer for continuous improvement. These documents are crucial for maintaining code quality and ensuring a smooth transition to a fully type-safe codebase.

- **[betterer-integration-plan.md](./betterer-integration-plan.md)**: This document outlines the comprehensive plan for integrating Betterer into the PinPoint project to track TypeScript migration progress and reorganize the CI pipeline. It details the installation of Betterer dependencies, the creation of the `.betterer.ts` configuration to monitor TypeScript strict mode errors and ESLint violations, and the reorganization of GitHub Actions into discrete, focused jobs. This plan aims to prevent regressions and provide clear feedback on code quality.
- **[betterer-quick-reference.md](./betterer-quick-reference.md)**: This document serves as a quick reference guide for daily usage of Betterer, providing commands for checking regressions, updating baselines after improvements, and using watch mode during development. It also explains how to interpret Betterer's output, what types of issues Betterer tracks, and offers tips for effective use. This guide is designed to help developers quickly integrate Betterer into their workflow.
- **[handoff-checklist.md](./handoff-checklist.md)**: This document provides a complete checklist for the successful implementation of the Betterer integration and the reorganization of the CI pipeline. It includes pre-implementation steps, detailed implementation instructions for installing dependencies, updating `package.json` and `eslint.config.js`, creating the initial Betterer baseline, and updating Husky pre-commit hooks. The checklist also covers post-implementation verification and troubleshooting, ensuring a smooth transition and proper setup of the new tooling.
