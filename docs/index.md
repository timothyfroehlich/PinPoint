# PinPoint Documentation

## ðŸš¨ Active Migration

PinPoint is completing a direct conversion migration from Prisma to Drizzle optimized for solo development velocity.

**Migration Status**: Phase 2B-E (Router Conversions)  
**Progress**: Phase 2A Drizzle Foundation Complete, 3 routers converted  
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks total direct conversion approach  
**Details**: [`migration/supabase-drizzle/`](./migration/supabase-drizzle/)

## Quick Start

### For New Developers

### Migration Patterns

- **ORM**: Prisma â†’ Drizzle Direct Conversion ([patterns](./migration/supabase-drizzle/quick-reference/prisma-to-drizzle.md))
- **Approach**: Direct router conversion without parallel validation ([guide](./developer-guides/drizzle/dual-orm-migration.md))
- **Testing**: Existing test patterns maintained during migration ([philosophy](./testing/))

### Architecture Principles

1. **Multi-tenant by design** - Application-level organization_id filtering
2. **Type-safe throughout** - Strictest TypeScript standards with tRPC + Drizzle
3. **Direct conversion approach** - Clean Drizzle implementations without validation overhead
4. **Progressive enhancement** - Public features work without auth

## Contributing

1. **Before coding**: Check migration status and use current patterns
2. **Validation**: Run `npm run validate` before commits
3. **Documentation**: Update relevant docs with any pattern changes
4. **Testing**: Write integration tests with transaction cleanup

For detailed contribution guidelines, see the migration developer guide.
