# Index of docs/testing/migration-reports

This directory contains individual migration reports generated during the process of migrating Jest tests to Vitest. Each report serves as a detailed record of the migration process for a specific test file, documenting the time taken, performance improvements, challenges encountered, and patterns discovered. These reports are valuable for understanding the migration progress, identifying reusable solutions, and benchmarking performance.

- **[2025-07-24-auth-tests-cleanup.md](./2025-07-24-auth-tests-cleanup.md)**: This report details the cleanup action of removing obsolete Jest files after verifying that their Vitest versions were fully functional. It summarizes the test count, types, and migration time, highlighting the performance results and the files processed. The document also outlines the actions taken, the impact on migration progress, and lessons learned regarding verification and batch cleanup, contributing to a cleaner and more efficient test suite.
- **[2025-07-24-authentication-migration-summary.md](./2025-07-24-authentication-migration-summary.md)**: This document provides a comprehensive summary of the complete migration of all authentication tests from Jest to Vitest. It presents a detailed table of migration results, including performance improvements for each file, and outlines the key patterns established during the process, such as `VitestMockContext` and `vi.hoisted()` for environment variables. The report also analyzes migration complexity, architecture improvements discovered, and best practices established, serving as a foundational guide for future migrations.
- **[2025-07-24-config-test.md](./2025-07-24-config-test.md)**: This report focuses on the migration of `config.test.ts`, detailing the challenges and solutions encountered, particularly with environment variable mocking using `vi.hoisted()`. It summarizes the test count, types, and performance improvements, and outlines the specific changes made, including basic updates, mocking changes, and special patterns. The document also shares lessons learned and architecture insights related to complex authentication configuration testing.
- **[README.md](./README.md)**: This file serves as the main introduction to the migration reports directory. It explains the purpose of the individual reports, their naming convention, and how they are generated. It also outlines how these reports are used as a historical record, pattern library, and performance benchmarks, and how they integrate with other testing documentation within the project.
