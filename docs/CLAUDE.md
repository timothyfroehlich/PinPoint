@INDEX.md

Documentation has been cleaned up and consolidated for context efficiency:
- Removed outdated migration references (Prisma removal complete)
- Simplified INDEX files for better navigation
- Archived obsolete files to .claude/recycle_bin/
- Focused on actionable patterns over explanations

Any doc file that is more than 500 lines after editing should be flagged for splitting.
