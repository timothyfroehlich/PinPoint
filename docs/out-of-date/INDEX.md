# Index of docs/out-of-date

This directory contains documentation that is considered out of date and should not be used as a primary reference for current development. These documents are kept for historical context or as a record of previous plans and specifications, but they do not reflect the current state or direction of the PinPoint project.

- **[product-specification.md](./product-specification.md)**: This document represents an outdated product specification for the PinPoint application. It details features, requirements, and design choices that are no longer current. Developers should refer to more recent planning and design documents for up-to-date product information.
- **[user-profile-implementation-plan.md](./user-profile-implementation-plan.md)**: This document outlines an outdated plan for the implementation of user profiles within the PinPoint system. The approaches, technologies, or features described here may have been superseded by newer strategies. For current user management and profile-related information, consult the most recent architectural and design documentation.
