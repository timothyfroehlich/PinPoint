# Drizzle ORM Developer Guide

Drizzle is a TypeScript ORM that provides type-safe database queries with a SQL-like syntax. It offers excellent TypeScript integration, zero dependencies, and generates highly optimized SQL queries. PinPoint uses Drizzle as a modern alternative to Prisma.

This guide covers PinPoint-specific patterns for Drizzle. For general documentation, see [orm.drizzle.team](https://orm.drizzle.team).
