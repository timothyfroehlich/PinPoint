This directory contains comprehensive guides for developers working on the PinPoint application, extending beyond the essential patterns found in the main `CLAUDE.md` file. These guides delve into specific tools, workflows, and common issues to provide in-depth assistance for various development scenarios.

- **[CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md)**: This file serves as a quick reference for essential development patterns and quick fixes, acting as a primary entry point for developers seeking immediate assistance. It cross-references other, more detailed guides within this directory, ensuring developers can quickly find the information they need.
- **[common-errors.md](./common-errors.md)**: This guide provides specific solutions for commonly encountered ESLint rule violations, particularly those related to TypeScript strictest mode and type-aware linting. It offers practical examples of bad and good code, covering type-safety rules like `no-explicit-any` and `no-unsafe-assignment`, as well as code style rules and project-specific patterns for Prisma client and tRPC context usage.
- **[troubleshooting.md](./troubleshooting.md)**: This guide covers common development issues beyond initial environment setup, offering solutions for TypeScript, test, build, and compilation problems. It also addresses workflow issues like pre-commit hook failures and database reset problems, providing debugging tools and emergency procedures for quick fixes and restoring known good states.
- **[typescript-guide.md](./typescript-guide.md)**: This comprehensive guide consolidates all TypeScript development knowledge for PinPoint, including the multi-config setup, error resolution patterns, and migration lessons learned. It covers different strictness levels for production code, test utilities, and test files, provides solutions for `@tsconfig/strictest` errors like `exactOptionalPropertyTypes` and `strictNullChecks`, and includes critical migration lessons from real-world experience including Prisma Accelerate issues, dependency cascade effects, and error count monitoring strategies.
