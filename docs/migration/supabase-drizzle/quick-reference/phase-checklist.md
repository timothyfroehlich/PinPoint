# Direct Conversion Migration Checklist

Quick reference for direct conversion migration tasks. See [GitHub Epic #200](https://github.com/timothyfroehlich/PinPoint/issues/200) for full details.

## Phase 2A: Drizzle Foundation ✅ COMPLETED (2025-08-02)

- [x] **Drizzle schema design** ([#208](https://github.com/timothyfroehlich/PinPoint/issues/208)) ✅ **Completed**
  - Complete 1:1 Prisma parity achieved across all tables
  - Modular 5-file schema organization: auth, organizations, machines, issues, collections
  - Essential multi-tenant indexes implemented correctly
  - 39 comprehensive tests validate foundation (27 CRUD + 12 integration)
  - Hot-reload optimization with singleton pattern

## Phase 2B: Initial Router Conversions ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] **qrCode.ts** - 1 query converted (simple machine lookup) ✅
- [x] **comment.ts** - 2 queries converted (joins with soft delete patterns) ✅
- [x] **admin.ts** - 18 queries converted (complex admin operations with bulk updates) ✅

**Current Status:** 3 routers successfully converted using direct approach

## Phase 2C-E: Remaining Router Migrations (In Progress)

**Target:** 13 remaining routers for direct conversion

### Phase 2C: Cleanup Existing Routers (2-3 days)

- [ ] Remove parallel validation from organization.ts (75 lines → ~25 lines)
- [ ] Remove parallel validation from user.ts (687 lines → ~200 lines)
- [ ] Remove parallel validation from machine.core.ts (509 lines → ~150 lines)
- [ ] Clean up role.ts (minimal changes, preserve service pattern)
- [ ] Eliminate ~400 lines of validation boilerplate

### Phase 2D: Simple & Medium Routers (1-2 weeks)

- [ ] Convert simple CRUD routers (3-4 routers)
- [ ] Convert medium complexity routers (5-6 routers)
- [ ] Test and validate each conversion immediately

### Phase 2E: Complex Routers (3-5 days)

- [ ] Convert complex routers with advanced business logic (3-4 routers)
- [ ] Address complex query patterns and multi-table operations
- [ ] Final integration testing

## Phase 3: Prisma Removal (1-2 days)

- [ ] Remove Prisma client from tRPC context
- [ ] Remove Prisma dependencies from package.json
- [ ] Clean up remaining Prisma imports
- [ ] Update documentation to reflect Drizzle-only approach

## Direct Conversion Approach

**Philosophy:** Clean, direct router-by-router conversion without parallel validation infrastructure

**Process:**

1. Enhanced drizzle-migration agent converts router
2. TypeScript validation ensures build passes
3. Manual testing validates functionality
4. Fix issues immediately before moving to next router

**Key Benefits:**

- 2-3 week timeline vs 6+ weeks with staged approach
- ~400 lines of boilerplate eliminated
- Clean, maintainable Drizzle implementations
- Deep learning of Drizzle patterns

## Rollback Strategy

**Router Level:** `git checkout filename.ts` for individual router rollback  
**Phase Level:** Revert to pre-phase git commit  
**Complete Rollback:** Return to Phase 2A foundation state
