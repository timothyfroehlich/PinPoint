# Organization Handling Vulnerabilities - Critical Security Audit

**Date**: 2025-08-28  
**Auditor**: Claude Code Agent  
**Scope**: Organization context management, authentication flow, and RLS policies  
**Severity**: HIGH - Critical architectural flaws requiring immediate attention

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive audit of the organization handling system revealed **5 critical vulnerabilities** and **3 architectural inconsistencies** that create significant security risks and operational instabilities. The current system has fundamental design flaws in user-organization relationships, metadata access patterns, and database-level isolation.

**Risk Level**: ðŸ”´ **HIGH** - Immediate action required
**User Impact**: Medium (application-layer filtering provides primary protection)
**Compliance Risk**: HIGH (lack of database-level isolation violates multi-tenant security standards)

## Critical Vulnerabilities

### 1. Metadata Access Inconsistency (CRITICAL)
**CVE-like ID**: PNT-2025-001  
**Severity**: High  
**CVSS Score**: 7.5

#### Technical Details
- **Location 1**: `src/lib/auth/server-context.ts:17` reads `user.user_metadata.organizationId`
- **Location 2**: `src/lib/dal/shared.ts:32` reads `user.app_metadata.organizationId`
- **Root Cause**: Mixed use of tamperable vs secure metadata

#### Security Impact
- `user_metadata` is client-modifiable through Supabase client libraries
- Attacker could potentially modify their `user_metadata.organizationId` to access other organizations
- Authentication context becomes inconsistent across different code paths
- Race conditions possible where two different systems read different organization contexts

#### Evidence
```typescript
// VULNERABLE - user can tamper with this
user.user_metadata?.["organizationId"]  

// SECURE - only service role can modify this  
user.app_metadata["organizationId"]
```

#### Attack Vector
1. User intercepts Supabase client calls
2. Modifies `user_metadata.organizationId` to target organization
3. Code paths reading from `user_metadata` grant unauthorized access
4. Potential bypass of organizational boundaries

### 2. Non-Functional RLS Policies (CRITICAL)
**CVE-like ID**: PNT-2025-002  
**Severity**: Critical  
**CVSS Score**: 9.1

#### Technical Details
- **File**: `src/server/db/setup-rls-local-supabase.sql`
- **Lines**: 92-170 (all policies use `USING (true)`)
- **Root Cause**: Placeholder policies that provide no actual protection

#### Security Impact
- **Database-level isolation completely absent**
- Single point of failure - if application-level filtering fails, no backup protection
- Regulatory compliance failures (GDPR, SOC 2 require database-level isolation)
- No audit trail of unauthorized access attempts at database level

#### Evidence
```sql
-- COMPLETELY BROKEN - no protection!
CREATE POLICY "issues_local_access" ON issues
  FOR ALL TO authenticated
  USING (true);  -- Anyone can access anything!
```

#### Exploitation Risk
- Any authenticated user could theoretically query any organization's data
- SQL injection vulnerabilities would have unlimited scope
- Database compromise would expose all organizational data

### 3. "Home Organization" Architecture Flaw (HIGH)
**CVE-like ID**: PNT-2025-003  
**Severity**: High  
**CVSS Score**: 6.8

#### Technical Details
- **Concept**: Users artificially tied to "primary" organization in `app_metadata.organizationId`
- **Problem**: Organization context needed at request time, not login time
- **Files Affected**: `src/app/auth/callback/route.ts:24`, multiple auth helpers

#### Security Impact
- **Multi-organization users cannot securely switch contexts**
- Race conditions between subdomain context and JWT organization claims  
- Undefined behavior when `subdomain != jwt.organizationId`
- Poor user experience leads to workarounds that bypass security

#### Attack Scenario
1. User has access to both `orgA` and `orgB`
2. JWT claims `organizationId = "orgA"` (set at login)
3. User visits `orgB.localhost:3000` (different context)
4. System has conflicting organization claims
5. Undefined behavior could grant inappropriate access

### 4. JWT vs Request Context Mismatch (HIGH)
**CVE-like ID**: PNT-2025-004  
**Severity**: High  
**CVSS Score**: 6.2

#### Technical Details
- **Root Cause**: Organization context determined at two different lifecycle points
- **JWT Claims**: Set at authentication time (login)
- **Request Context**: Determined at request time (subdomain)
- **Conflict**: These can legitimately differ for multi-org users

#### Security Impact
- **Unpredictable access control decisions**
- Different code paths may make different organization context assumptions
- Multi-tab usage creates conflicting organization contexts
- Session state becomes inconsistent

#### Evidence
```
Tab 1: orgA.localhost:3000 (wants orgA context)
Tab 2: orgB.localhost:3000 (wants orgB context)  
JWT: { organizationId: "orgA" } (single context)
Result: Undefined behavior, potential data leakage
```

### 5. Missing Anonymous Access Architecture (MEDIUM)
**CVE-like ID**: PNT-2025-005  
**Severity**: Medium  
**CVSS Score**: 4.3

#### Technical Details
- **Current State**: System assumes all users are authenticated members
- **Business Need**: Anonymous users must report issues across organizations
- **Missing Components**: Anonymous RLS policies, public data visibility controls

#### Security Impact
- **Feature gaps force workarounds** that may bypass security
- No proper isolation for anonymous cross-organizational access
- Potential data exposure through overly permissive anonymous policies

#### Business Impact
- Core feature (anonymous issue reporting) not properly supported
- QR code workflows require authentication workarounds
- Public information discovery limited

## Architectural Inconsistencies

### 1. User-Organization Relationship Model
**Problem**: Current model treats users as "belonging to" organizations
**Correct Model**: Users as independent entities with memberships
**Impact**: Breaks multi-tenant patterns, creates artificial hierarchies

### 2. Session Variable Usage
**Problem**: RLS session variables set but not used by policies
**Evidence**: `SET LOCAL app.current_organization_id` called but policies ignore it
**Impact**: Performance overhead with no security benefit

### 3. Subdomain Resolution Fallback Logic
**Problem**: Complex fallback logic creates multiple code paths
**Risk**: Edge cases in organization resolution could bypass security
**Location**: `src/server/api/trpc.base.ts:154-185`

## Risk Assessment

### Immediate Risks (Next 30 Days)
- **Application-layer filter bypass** could expose cross-organizational data

3. **Developer experience** - Clear patterns for organization-scoped operations
4. **Monitoring and alerting** - Detect potential security issues in real-time

## Testing Requirements

### Security Test Cases
1. **Cross-organizational data leakage** - Verify complete isolation between organizations
2. **Anonymous access boundaries** - Confirm public data limits are enforced
3. **Multi-organization user behavior** - Test context switching and access levels
4. **RLS policy enforcement** - Database-level isolation independent of application logic

### Edge Case Testing
1. **Malformed subdomain handling** - Prevent injection or bypass attempts
2. **Session state corruption** - Behavior when organization context is invalid
3. **Concurrent organization access** - Multi-tab usage patterns
4. **User membership changes** - Real-time access control updates

## Conclusion

The organization handling system requires **immediate architectural redesign** to address critical security vulnerabilities and operational instabilities. While application-level filtering currently provides protection against data exposure, the fundamental design flaws create significant long-term risks for security, compliance, and user experience.

The recommended approach of **organization-agnostic users with request-time context resolution** addresses all identified vulnerabilities while supporting the full spectrum of required access patterns from anonymous issue reporting to complex multi-organizational member workflows.

**Next Steps**: Prioritize metadata consistency fixes and RLS policy implementation before adding new organizational features or onboarding additional customers.
