# Documentation Update Summary

Date: 2025-01-14

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive documentation update performed to ensure all PinPoint documentation is current, well-organized, and won't mislead other agents or developers.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Documentation Index

- Added `/docs/README.md` as central navigation point
- Clear categorization of documents by status (current/historical/planned)
- Quick reference sections for commands and standards

### 2. Archived Historical Documents

- Moved `overview.md` â†’ `planning/archive/overview.md`
- Moved `feature-spec.md` â†’ `planning/archive/feature-spec.md`
- Added headers indicating archived status and linking to current docs

### 3. Updated Current Documents

#### production-readiness-tasks.md

- Added status indicators (âœ… completed, ðŸ”„ in progress, ðŸ“‹ pending)
- Marked completed tasks (T3 env, ESLint config, code coverage)
- Added references to current development standards

#### technical-design-document.md

- Added comprehensive development workflow section
- Documented code quality standards (0 TS/ESLint errors)
- Added ESM module configuration details
- Included current dev commands and pre-production practices

#### testing-design-doc.md

- Updated with current coverage thresholds (50%/60%/70%)
- Added ESM configuration and typed mock patterns
- Included test running commands
- Added best practices section

### 4. Created New Reference Documents

#### /docs/architecture/current-state.md

- Comprehensive documentation of as-built architecture
- Implementation status for all major components
- Current limitations and planned improvements
- Key implementation decisions

#### /docs/reference/terminology.md

- Complete glossary of terms
- Model rename mapping (GameTitleâ†’Model, etc.)
- API procedure types and patterns
- Common abbreviations

### 5. Reorganized Directory Structure

- Removed empty `/docs/other/` directory
- Moved `video-upload-strategy.md` â†’ `planning/future-features/`
- Removed empty `/docs/ideas/` directory
- Created new directories: `architecture/`, `reference/`

### 6. Documentation Standards

All documents now include standardized headers:

```yaml
---
status: current|archived|planned
last-updated: YYYY-MM-DD
superseded-by: [optional link]
---
```

## Key Principles Applied

1. **Clear Status Indication**: Every document clearly indicates if it's current, archived, or planned
2. **No Redundancy**: Removed duplicate information, consolidated where appropriate
3. **Authoritative Sources**: Clearly identified which documents are authoritative
4. **Historical Context**: Preserved historical documents with clear archival notes
5. **Current State Focus**: Created new documents reflecting actual implementation

## Documents Not Modified

- `subdomain-development-setup.md` - Already fully current
- `user-profile-implementation-plan.md` - Kept as-is in out-of-date folder (unimplemented)
- `troubleshooting.md` - Already current and actively maintained
- `coverage-setup.md` - Recent addition, already current
- Backend implementation tasks - Well-structured and current

## Result

The documentation is now:

- **Well-organized** with clear navigation
- **Current** reflecting the actual implementation state
- **Non-misleading** with clear status indicators
- **Comprehensive** covering architecture, terminology, and workflows
- **Maintainable** with standards for future updates

This ensures that other agents and developers will have accurate, up-to-date information when working on the PinPoint project.
