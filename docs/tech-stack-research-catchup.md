Technical Briefing: Key Developments in the TypeScript Ecosystem (Post-November 2025)

This document provides a comprehensive technical update for AI coding agents with a knowledge baseline of November 2025. It details the significant architectural shifts, API evolutions, and new best practices for Drizzle ORM, Supabase, Next.js, Material UI, and Vitest. The central themes of this evolution are a decisive move towards server-centric logic, a deepening commitment to end-to-end TypeScript type safety, and the maturation of testing methodologies to accommodate these new paradigms.

Drizzle ORM - Embracing Advanced SQL & Type-Safe Validation

Drizzle has evolved from a lightweight, SQL-like query builder into a mature ORM that provides type-safe access to advanced, dialect-specific database features. This progression demonstrates a commitment to empowering developers who are proficient in SQL, rather than abstracting it away, thereby maintaining high performance while adding a critical layer of type safety.1 The introduction of features like native support for PostgreSQL extensions and generated columns is a direct response to the needs of modern applications, such as those involving AI and complex data analytics, where advanced database capabilities are essential. Drizzle's strategy is to map these powerful SQL features into its TypeScript API, ensuring that developers do not have to sacrifice type safety for functionality.

Quick-Reference: Core Updates & API Evolution

New Feature: Generated Columns (v0.32.0+): Drizzle now natively supports both VIRTUAL and STORED generated columns across PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite. This feature allows for the definition of columns whose values are automatically computed from other columns within the same table. By defining this logic at the schema level in TypeScript, it replaces the need for manual calculation of derived fields in application code or the use of complex database triggers, ensuring data consistency and moving logic closer to the data itself.2
New Feature: React Live Queries for Expo SQLite (v0.31.1+): The useLiveQuery hook has been introduced for Expo and React Native applications. This hook establishes a reactive connection to the local SQLite database, automatically re-running queries and updating the UI when the underlying data changes. This obviates the need for manual data-fetching and state-synchronization logic (e.g., using libraries like React Query) for local database interactions in mobile applications.2
New Feature: Enhanced PostgreSQL Extension Support (v0.31.0+): Native support has been added for popular PostgreSQL extensions, most notably pg_vector for AI applications and PostGIS for geospatial data. This includes new Drizzle types (vector, geometry) and functions that integrate directly with the query builder. This enhancement replaces the previous method of using raw, untyped SQL queries via the sql operator for these specialized tasks, bringing full type safety to vector similarity searches and geospatial queries.6
Breaking Change: PostgreSQL Indexes API (v0.31.0): The API for defining PostgreSQL indexes was fundamentally overhauled to align with correct PostgreSQL syntax and capabilities. The previous API was flawed, as it applied modifiers like .asc() or .desc() to the entire index rather than to individual columns and did not permit the use of SQL expressions within the index definition. The new API corrects this by allowing modifiers (.asc(), .desc(), .nullsFirst(), .nullsLast()) to be chained directly to specific columns within the .on() or .using() methods, providing the granular control required by the database engine.2
Key Improvement: Validator Integrations (drizzle-zod, etc.): The ecosystem of validation libraries that integrate with Drizzle has seen continuous improvement and bug fixes. These libraries, such as drizzle-zod, allow for the automatic generation of validation schemas (e.g., for Zod) directly from Drizzle's table definitions. This reinforces Drizzle's commitment to end-to-end type safety, ensuring that data shapes are consistent from the database schema definition through to API-level validation.7

Implementation: Advanced Schema and Querying

The following examples illustrate the implementation of Drizzle's new and improved features, focusing on type-safe and idiomatic usage.

Defining Generated Columns for Full-Text Search

Generated columns can offload complex computations to the database. The example below defines a tsvector column in PostgreSQL that automatically combines the title and body of a post for efficient full-text searching. The .generatedAlwaysAs() method accepts the sql helper, allowing type-safe references to other columns in the table.

TypeScript

// src/db/schema.ts
import { sql } from 'drizzle-orm';
import { index, pgTable, serial, text, customType } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';

// Define a custom type for tsvector to ensure type safety
export const tsvector = customType<{ data: string; }>({
dataType() {
return `tsvector`;
},
});

export const posts = pgTable(
'posts',
{
id: serial().primaryKey(),
title: text('title').notNull(),
body: text('body').notNull(),
// The generated column combines title and body with different weights.
// The value is STORED, meaning it's computed on write and indexed for fast reads.
search: tsvector('search').generatedAlwaysAs(
sql`setweight(to_tsvector('english', "title"), 'A') |

| setweight(to_tsvector('english', "body"), 'B')`,
{ mode: 'stored' }
).notNull(),
},
(table) => ({
// A GIN index is recommended for tsvector columns for performance.
searchIndex: index('idx_search').on(table.search).using('gin'),
})
);

This schema definition moves the responsibility of creating the search vector from the application layer to the database itself, ensuring consistency and leveraging PostgreSQL's powerful indexing capabilities.3

Relational Queries API (db.query)

Drizzle's Relational Queries API (db.query) provides a convenient and performant way to fetch nested data structures without writing manual SQL joins or suffering from the N+1 problem. It relies on relations helpers defined alongside your table schemas.

TypeScript

// src/db/schema.ts (continued)
import { relations } from 'drizzle-orm';
import { integer } from 'drizzle-orm/pg-core';

export const users = pgTable('users', {
id: serial().primaryKey(),
name: text('name').notNull(),
});

export const comments = pgTable('comments', {
id: serial().primaryKey(),
text: text('text').notNull(),
postId: integer().references(() => posts.id),
authorId: integer('author_id').references(() => users.id),
});

// Define the relationships between tables
export const usersRelations = relations(users, ({ many }) => ({
comments: many(comments),
}));

export const postsRelations = relations(posts, ({ many }) => ({
comments: many(comments),
}));

export const commentsRelations = relations(comments, ({ one }) => ({
post: one(posts, { fields: [comments.postId], references: [posts.id] }),
author: one(users, { fields: [comments.authorId], references: [users.id] }),
}));

// --- In your application code ---
// Fetch all posts, each with its associated comments, and each comment with its author.
const postsWithCommentsAndAuthors = await db.query.posts.findMany({
with: {
comments: {
with: {
author: {
columns: {
name: true, // Only select the author's name
},
},
},
},
},
});

This single query will be translated by Drizzle into a performant SQL statement that retrieves all the requested data. The resulting TypeScript type is fully inferred, providing autocompletion and compile-time safety for the nested data structure.10

Using React Live Queries in Expo

The useLiveQuery hook simplifies state management in React Native apps built with Expo. It requires enabling change listeners when opening the database connection. The hook returns an object containing data, error, and updatedAt fields, similar to popular data-fetching libraries.

TypeScript

// App.tsx (in an Expo/React Native project)
import { useLiveQuery, drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/expo-sqlite';
import { openDatabaseSync } from 'expo-sqlite';
import { Text, View, FlatList } from 'react-native';
import \* as schema from './db/schema';

// Enable change listeners for live queries to function
const expoDb = openDatabaseSync('app.db', { enableChangeListener: true });
const db = drizzle(expoDb, { schema });

function UserList() {
// The useLiveQuery hook subscribes to changes affecting this query.
const { data: users, error } = useLiveQuery(
db.query.users.findMany({
orderBy: (users, { desc }) => [desc(users.id)],
})
);

if (error) {
return <Text>Error fetching users: {error.message}</Text>;
}

// The component will automatically re-render when the users table is modified.
return (
<View>
<FlatList
data={users}
keyExtractor={(item) => item.id.toString()}
renderItem={({ item }) => <Text>{item.name}</Text>}
/>
</View>
);
}

This pattern provides a reactive data layer directly connected to the local SQLite database, significantly simplifying development for data-driven mobile applications.4

Testing & Mocking Strategies

Effective testing of database logic requires isolating tests from external database services. A powerful strategy for Drizzle is to use an in-memory database that mirrors the production environment.

Unit Testing with an In-Memory PostgreSQL Database

Vitest can be configured to replace the standard PostgreSQL driver (node-postgres) with pglite, a fully-featured PostgreSQL server compiled to WebAssembly that runs entirely in memory within the Node.js process. This provides a high-fidelity, zero-dependency testing environment.
The configuration is typically done in a test setup file specified in vitest.config.ts.

TypeScript

// vitest.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config';

export default defineConfig({
test: {
globals: true,
setupFiles: ['./vitest.setup.ts'], // Specify the setup file
},
});

// vitest.setup.ts
import { vi } from 'vitest';
import \* as schema from './src/db/schema';

// Mock the database connection module before any tests run.
vi.mock('./src/db/index.ts', async (importOriginal) => {
// Dynamically import necessary libraries for the mock environment
const { PGlite } = await vi.importActual<typeof import('@electric-sql/pglite')>('@electric-sql/pglite');
const { drizzle } = await vi.importActual<typeof import('drizzle-orm/pglite')>('drizzle-orm/pglite');
const { migrate } = await vi.importActual<typeof import('drizzle-orm/pglite/migrator')>('drizzle-orm/pglite/migrator');
const migrations = await import('./drizzle/migrations');

// Create an in-memory PGlite client for each test suite
const client = new PGlite();
const db = drizzle(client, { schema });

// Apply all generated migrations to the in-memory database
await migrate(db, migrations);

// Return the mocked module, exporting the in-memory db instance
const originalModule = await importOriginal<typeof import('./src/db/index.ts')>();
return {
...originalModule,
db, // Override the production db instance with our test instance
};
});

This setup ensures that every test file runs against a clean, migrated, in-memory PostgreSQL database. This approach allows for fast, reliable, and isolated integration tests of the data layer without the overhead of managing external Docker containers or test databases.11

Supabase - Maturing into a Server-Centric Platform

Supabase has undergone a significant architectural alignment to better integrate with the server-centric patterns of modern web frameworks, particularly Next.js. This shift is most evident in its authentication strategy, which has moved from client-focused helpers to a robust, server-side, cookie-based session management system. This evolution was driven by the rise of React Server Components, which necessitated a more secure and performant way to handle user sessions on the server. Alongside this, Supabase has expanded its core platform with powerful backend primitives like cron jobs and message queues, positioning itself as a more comprehensive and integrated backend solution.

Quick-Reference: Core Updates & Deprecations

Key Deprecation: @supabase/auth-helpers: The collection of framework-specific authentication helper libraries (e.g., @supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs) is now deprecated. These libraries were designed around client-side token management, which is incompatible with the server-centric model of modern frameworks.
Replaced By: @supabase/ssr: A new, unified library specifically designed for server-side rendering (SSR) environments. It provides a secure, cookie-based session management solution that works seamlessly with Next.js App Router, Server Components, and Server Actions, ensuring that authentication state can be reliably accessed and managed on the server.12
New Recommended Pattern: Realtime Broadcast: For listening to database changes, the "Broadcast" method is now the recommended approach due to its superior scalability and security. This pattern uses database triggers to send custom messages over private, authenticated channels, requiring explicit Row Level Security (RLS) policies to authorize subscriptions.14
Replaces: The older "Postgres Changes" method, which relies on logical replication (WAL2JSON). While simpler to set up, it does not scale as effectively and has significant security limitations, particularly as RLS policies are not applied to DELETE operations, potentially leaking information about deleted records.14
New Backend Capabilities: The platform has been enhanced with Postgres-native features that reduce the need for external services or complex application logic for common backend tasks.
Cron Jobs (pg_cron): A powerful scheduler for automating recurring tasks. It can execute SQL statements, call database functions, or invoke webhooks at specified intervals.16
Queues (pgmq): A durable, Postgres-native message queue system. It enables the management of asynchronous jobs and background tasks directly within the database, ensuring reliability and simplifying application architecture.16
Declarative Schemas: A new workflow that allows developers to define their database structure in a centralized, version-controlled manner, improving maintainability and collaboration.16

Implementation: Modern Authentication and Realtime

The following examples demonstrate the new best practices for implementing authentication and realtime features in a Supabase and Next.js application.

Server-Side Authentication with Next.js App Router

Implementing authentication with @supabase/ssr involves a coordinated effort between server-side utilities, client-side utilities, and Next.js middleware.
Create Supabase Clients: Create separate clients for server and client environments.
TypeScript
// utils/supabase/server.ts
import { createServerClient } from '@supabase/ssr';
import { cookies } from 'next/headers';

export function createClient() {
const cookieStore = cookies();
return createServerClient(
process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!,
{
cookies: {
get: (name) => cookieStore.get(name)?.value,
set: (name, value, options) => cookieStore.set({ name, value,...options }),
remove: (name, options) => cookieStore.set({ name, value: '',...options }),
},
}
);
}

TypeScript
// utils/supabase/client.ts
import { createBrowserClient } from '@supabase/ssr';

export function createClient() {
return createBrowserClient(
process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!
);
}

Implement Middleware for Session Management: Since Server Components cannot set cookies, middleware is essential for refreshing and persisting the user's session across requests.
TypeScript
// middleware.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server';
import { createServerClient } from '@supabase/ssr';

export async function middleware(request) {
const supabase = createServerClient(/_... _/);
// This call is crucial: it refreshes the auth token if it's expired.
await supabase.auth.getUser();
return NextResponse.next();
}

Protect Routes in Server Components: Fetch user data securely within an async Server Component. If no user is found, redirect to a login page.
TypeScript
// app/protected-page/page.tsx
import { createClient } from '@/utils/supabase/server';
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation';

export default async function ProtectedPage() {
const supabase = createClient();
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser();

if (!user) {
redirect('/login');
}

return <p>Hello, {user.email}</p>;
}

Handle Sign-in with a Server Action: Use a Next.js Server Action to handle form submissions for authentication, keeping credentials on the server.
TypeScript
// app/login/actions.ts
'use server';
import { createClient } from '@/utils/supabase/server';
import { redirect } from 'next/navigation';

export async function login(formData: FormData) {
const supabase = createClient();
const email = formData.get('email') as string;
const password = formData.get('password') as string;

const { error } = await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({ email, password });

if (error) {
return redirect('/login?message=Could not authenticate user');
}

return redirect('/protected-page');
}

This server-centric flow ensures that JWTs are handled securely in HTTP-only cookies and are accessible to server-side logic without being exposed to the client-side JavaScript context.13

Implementing Realtime Broadcast

The Broadcast pattern provides a more secure and scalable way to implement realtime functionality.
Create a PostgreSQL Trigger Function: This function will be executed on database events and will send a payload to a specific realtime channel.
SQL
-- SQL to create the trigger function
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION public.notify_new_message()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
-- Broadcast a message on the 'messages' channel with the new record
PERFORM realtime.broadcast('messages', row_to_json(NEW)::text);
RETURN NEW;
END;

$$
LANGUAGE plpgsql;


Attach the Trigger to a Table:
SQL
-- SQL to attach the trigger
CREATE TRIGGER on_new_message
AFTER INSERT ON public.messages
FOR EACH ROW EXECUTE FUNCTION public.notify_new_message();


Subscribe on the Client: On the client side, subscribe to the private broadcast channel to receive updates.
TypeScript
// components/RealtimeMessages.tsx
'use client';
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import { createClient } from '@/utils/supabase/client';

export default function RealtimeMessages() {
  const [messages, setMessages] = useState();
  const supabase = createClient();

  useEffect(() => {
    const channel = supabase
     .channel('messages')
     .on('broadcast', { event: 'new_message' }, (payload) => {
        setMessages((prevMessages) => [...prevMessages, payload.payload]);
      })
     .subscribe();

    return () => {
      supabase.removeChannel(channel);
    };
  }, [supabase]);

  return (
    <ul>
      {messages.map((msg) => <li key={msg.id}>{msg.content}</li>)}
    </ul>
  );
}


This pattern ensures that only authorized clients can subscribe to channels and that the realtime system can scale effectively with a large number of concurrent listeners.14

Testing & Mocking Strategies

Testing components that interact with Supabase requires mocking the client to isolate the component from network requests and database state.

Mocking the Supabase Server Client in Vitest

When testing a Next.js Server Component that uses the Supabase server client, the test will fail because next/headers (which the client uses to access cookies) is not available in the JSDOM test environment. This can be resolved by mocking the next/headers module.

TypeScript


// __tests__/ProtectedPage.test.tsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { vi } from 'vitest';
import ProtectedPage from '@/app/protected-page/page';

// Mock the next/headers module
vi.mock('next/headers', () => ({
  cookies: () => ({
    get: vi.fn().mockReturnValue({ value: 'fake-session-cookie' }),
  }),
}));

// Mock the Supabase server client to control its behavior
vi.mock('@/utils/supabase/server', () => ({
  createClient: () => ({
    auth: {
      getUser: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({
        data: { user: { id: '123', email: 'test@example.com' } },
        error: null,
      }),
    },
  }),
}));

test('renders user email when authenticated', async () => {
  // The component is async, so we must await its resolution before rendering
  const PageComponent = await ProtectedPage();
  render(PageComponent);

  expect(screen.getByText('Hello, test@example.com')).toBeInTheDocument();
});


This test successfully isolates the Server Component by providing mock implementations for its server-side dependencies.17

Mocking the Supabase Auth Client

For client-side components that depend on authentication state, the Supabase browser client can be mocked to simulate different user sessions.

TypeScript


// __tests__/UserProfile.test.tsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { vi } from 'vitest';
import UserProfile from '@/components/UserProfile';

// Mock the Supabase browser client
vi.mock('@/utils/supabase/client', () => ({
  createClient: () => ({
    auth: {
      getSession: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({
        data: { session: { user: { id: '123', email: 'user@example.com' } } },
      }),
    },
  }),
}));

test('displays user email when a session exists', async () => {
  render(<UserProfile />);

  // Wait for the component to finish its async operations
  const emailDisplay = await screen.findByText('user@example.com');
  expect(emailDisplay).toBeInTheDocument();
});


This approach allows for comprehensive testing of UI components under various authentication scenarios without needing a live Supabase backend.18

Next.js Framework - The Server-Centric Revolution

The introduction and stabilization of the App Router in Next.js versions 13 through 15 marks a fundamental re-architecting of full-stack web development. This paradigm shift moves the application's center of gravity from the client to the server, aiming to eliminate client-server request waterfalls and simplify data management by co-locating data logic with the UI that depends on it. This server-centric model is built on three core primitives: React Server Components for data fetching, Server Actions for data mutations, and a sophisticated, integrated caching layer. The result is a more cohesive and performant architecture where the distinction between "frontend" and "backend" code blurs, as data lifecycle management becomes a first-class citizen within the React component model itself.

Quick-Reference: The App Router Paradigm

The transition from the Pages Router to the App Router involves a comprehensive change in conventions for routing, data fetching, and state management. The following table provides a direct comparison of the legacy and modern patterns, serving as a quick-reference guide for updating development practices.

Feature
Pages Router (Legacy)
App Router (Recommended)
Routing
File-based in /pages directory. Each .js or .tsx file maps to a route.
Folder-based in /app directory. A page.tsx file within a folder defines the route's UI.19
Data Fetching (Read)
Specialized functions (getServerSideProps, getStaticProps) exported from a page file.19
async Server Components that directly use fetch or a database client to retrieve data.22
Data Mutations (Write)
API Routes in /pages/api. The client makes a fetch request to a dedicated API endpoint.24
Server Actions: async functions marked with the 'use server' directive, callable directly from components.25
Layouts
A single global layout in _app.js and per-page layout components implemented manually.
File-based nested layouts using layout.tsx files, which automatically wrap child segments.19
Caching
Configured via response headers in getServerSideProps or the revalidate option in getStaticProps.
Granular control via fetch options (cache, next: { revalidate, tags }), on-demand revalidation (revalidatePath, revalidateTag), and the 'use cache' directive.26
Loading UI
Handled client-side with component state (e.g., useState(true)) and conditional rendering.
Built-in support via loading.tsx file conventions and React <Suspense> boundaries for streaming UI.22


Implementation: Server-Centric Patterns

The following examples showcase the core patterns of the App Router, demonstrating how to fetch, mutate, and cache data within the new server-centric model.

Data Fetching in Server Components

Server Components can be declared as async functions, allowing for direct, top-level await of data fetching operations. This eliminates the need for data fetching hooks like useEffect or special functions like getServerSideProps.

TypeScript


// app/posts/page.tsx
import { db } from '@/lib/db'; // Drizzle client instance

// This is a React Server Component.
// It executes exclusively on the server.
export default async function PostsPage() {
  // Directly query the database within the component.
  const posts = await db.query.posts.findMany();

  return (
    <main>
      <h1>All Posts</h1>
      <ul>
        {posts.map((post) => (
          <li key={post.id}>{post.title}</li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </main>
  );
}


This pattern simplifies code by co-locating data dependencies with the components that use them, and improves performance by fetching data on the server before the initial render.22

Mutating Data with Server Actions

Server Actions are the standard for handling data mutations. They are secure by default, as the code only ever runs on the server. They can be defined in a separate file and imported into both Server and Client Components.

TypeScript


// lib/actions.ts
'use server'; // Marks all exports in this file as Server Actions

import { db } from '@/lib/db';
import { posts } from '@/lib/db/schema';
import { revalidatePath } from 'next/cache';

export async function createPost(formData: FormData) {
  const title = formData.get('title') as string;
  const content = formData.get('content') as string;

  await db.insert(posts).values({ title, content });

  // Revalidate the cache for the posts page, triggering a data refresh.
  revalidatePath('/posts');
}



TypeScript


// components/CreatePostForm.tsx
import { createPost } from '@/lib/actions';

export function CreatePostForm() {
  return (
    // The form's `action` attribute is bound directly to the Server Action.
    <form action={createPost}>
      <input type="text" name="title" required />
      <textarea name="content" required />
      <button type="submit">Create Post</button>
    </form>
  );
}


Upon form submission, Next.js handles the network request to the server, executes the createPost function, and, thanks to revalidatePath, automatically refreshes the data on the /posts page, providing an updated UI in a single roundtrip.25

Advanced Caching with 'use cache'

The 'use cache' directive is a powerful tool for memoizing the return value of a function within a single server request. It is distinct from the fetch cache or the Data Cache; it prevents re-running the same function with the same arguments multiple times during a single render pass on the server.

TypeScript


// lib/data.ts
import 'server-only';

export async function getUser(id: string) {
  'use cache'; // This directive enables memoization for this function.

  // This database query will only run once per request for a given `id`.
  const user = await db.query.users.findFirst({ where: (users, { eq }) => eq(users.id, id) });
  return user;
}


If getUser('123') is called from multiple different components within the same server render, the database query will only be executed once. Subsequent calls with the same id will receive the memoized result, optimizing performance and reducing database load.27

Testing & Mocking Strategies

Testing in the App Router paradigm requires new approaches, particularly for Server Actions and async Server Components.

Unit Testing Server Actions

Server Actions can be unit-tested by mocking the action module itself and its internal dependencies. This allows for testing the interaction (e.g., a form submission) and asserting that the action was called correctly.

TypeScript


// __tests__/CreatePostForm.test.tsx
import { render, screen, fireEvent } from '@testing-library/react';
import { vi } from 'vitest';
import { CreatePostForm } from '@/components/CreatePostForm';
import * as actions from '@/lib/actions';

// Mock the entire actions module.
vi.mock('@/lib/actions');

test('form submission calls createPost Server Action', async () => {
  // Provide a mock implementation for the action.
  const createPostMock = vi.mocked(actions.createPost).mockResolvedValue();

  render(<CreatePostForm />);

  const titleInput = screen.getByRole('textbox');
  const contentInput = screen.getByRole('textbox', { name: /content/i });
  const submitButton = screen.getByRole('button');

  fireEvent.change(titleInput, { target: { value: 'Test Title' } });
  fireEvent.change(contentInput, { target: { value: 'Test Content' } });
  fireEvent.click(submitButton);

  // Assert that the mocked action was called.
  await vi.waitFor(() => {
    expect(createPostMock).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
    // Further assertions can be made on the FormData passed to the mock.
  });
});


This pattern effectively tests the client-side invocation of the Server Action while isolating the test from the action's server-side implementation.31

Limitations of Testing Async Server Components

Unit testing async Server Components with tools like Vitest and JSDOM is currently not officially supported and presents significant challenges. The test environment cannot fully replicate the Next.js server runtime, React Server Component rendering pipeline, or the integrated data cache. Consequently, attempting to unit test these components often leads to errors or unreliable results.
The official recommendation from the Next.js team is to use End-to-End (E2E) tests with tools like Playwright or Cypress for async components. E2E tests run the application in a real browser environment, allowing for the validation of the entire user flow, including data fetching, rendering, and interaction, as a user would experience it.32

Material UI (MUI) - Modernization and Interoperability

The release of Material UI v7 represents a significant step in the library's maturation, focusing on API consolidation and improved interoperability within the modern CSS ecosystem. This release is not characterized by a large number of new components but rather by a strategic cleanup of the API surface and the adoption of modern web standards to address common developer pain points. The most impactful change is the introduction of opt-in support for CSS Cascade Layers. This feature was a direct response to the growing trend of developers using MUI alongside utility-first CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS, where CSS specificity conflicts were a frequent and difficult problem to solve. By embracing CSS Layers, MUI has positioned itself as a more flexible and cooperative citizen in a diverse styling landscape.

Quick-Reference: v7 Upgrade Synopsis

API Cleanup: A large number of APIs that were marked as deprecated in v5 have been officially removed in v7. This streamlines the library, simplifies documentation, and reduces the overall API surface, making it easier for developers to learn and use correctly.33
Removed: createMuiTheme (replaced by createTheme), the Hidden component (replaced by the responsive sx prop), and component-specific props like onBackdropClick (functionality merged into the onClose callback).
Component Migration: Many popular and widely-used components have been promoted from the experimental @mui/lab package into the core @mui/material package. This move signals their API stability and readiness for production use.33
Moved to Core: Autocomplete, Pagination, Rating, Skeleton, Alert, ToggleButtonGroup, and AvatarGroup.
New Feature: CSS Layers Support: MUI v7 introduces opt-in support for CSS Cascade Layers. When enabled, MUI wraps its generated styles in a dedicated @layer mui. This gives developers explicit control over CSS precedence, allowing them to define a clear order of styles and resolve specificity conflicts when integrating MUI with other styling libraries, most notably Tailwind CSS.33
Styling Engine: Emotion continues to be the default styling engine for MUI. The documentation and packages for using styled-components as an alternative have been updated to ensure compatibility with the latest versions.36

Implementation: Styling and Migration

The following examples demonstrate how to implement the new CSS Layers feature and handle common migration tasks when upgrading to MUI v7.

Enabling CSS Layers in a Next.js App Router Project

To enable CSS Layers, you must wrap your application's root layout with the AppRouterCacheProvider from @mui/material-nextjs and set the enableCssLayer option to true. Additionally, a GlobalStyles component should be used to define the order of the layers.

TypeScript


// app/layout.tsx
import { AppRouterCacheProvider } from '@mui/material-nextjs/v15-appRouter';
import { ThemeProvider } from '@mui/material/styles';
import GlobalStyles from '@mui/material/GlobalStyles';
import theme from '../theme';

export default function RootLayout(props) {
  const { children } = props;
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <AppRouterCacheProvider options={{ enableCssLayer: true }}>
          {/*
            Define the order of CSS layers.
            MUI styles will be injected into the 'mui' layer.
            Custom component styles can go into 'components', etc.
          */}
          <GlobalStyles styles="@layer theme, base, mui, components, utilities;" />
          <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
            {children}
          </ThemeProvider>
        </AppRouterCacheProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}


This setup ensures that MUI's styles are contained within their own layer, preventing them from unintentionally overriding styles from other libraries (like Tailwind's utilities) that are defined in a later layer.35

Migrating from Deprecated APIs: Hidden to sx Prop

A common migration path for v7 is replacing the removed Hidden component. The recommended replacement is the sx prop, which provides a more modern and flexible API for responsive styling directly on the component.
Before (MUI v5/v6):
JavaScript
import { Hidden, Paper } from '@mui/material';

function ResponsiveComponent() {
  // This component would be hidden on screens 'md' and smaller.
  return (
    <Hidden implementation="css" mdDown>
      <Paper>Visible on large screens only</Paper>
    </Hidden>
  );
}


After (MUI v7):
JavaScript
import { Paper } from '@mui/material';

function ResponsiveComponent() {
  return (
    <Paper
      sx={{
        // The `display` property is an object with breakpoint keys.
        // It's hidden by default (xs) and becomes visible at the 'md' breakpoint.
        display: { xs: 'none', md: 'block' }
      }}
    >
      Visible on large screens only
    </Paper>
  );
}


This migration not only updates to the new API but also adopts a more intuitive and co-located styling pattern.33

Testing & Mocking Strategies

When testing MUI components, it is crucial to provide a theme context to ensure that components that rely on theme values (such as colors, spacing, or typography) render correctly and consistently.

Component Testing with a Mock Theme

In this Vitest example, a CustomButton component is tested. The component's color is derived from a custom property on the theme's palette. The test wraps the component in a ThemeProvider with a specifically crafted mock theme to verify this behavior in isolation.

TypeScript


// components/CustomButton.tsx
import Button from '@mui/material/Button';
import { styled } from '@mui/material/styles';

const StyledButton = styled(Button)(({ theme }) => ({
  // This color comes from a custom theme property.
  backgroundColor: theme.palette.special.main,
}));

export function CustomButton() {
  return <StyledButton>Special Button</StyledButton>;
}

// __tests__/CustomButton.test.tsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import { vi } from 'vitest';
import { ThemeProvider, createTheme } from '@mui/material/styles';
import { CustomButton } from '@/components/CustomButton';

test('renders with special background color from theme', () => {
  // 1. Create a mock theme with the custom properties the component expects.
  const mockTheme = createTheme({
    palette: {
      special: {
        main: 'rgb(255, 0, 0)', // A specific color for assertion
      },
    },
  });

  // 2. Wrap the component in the ThemeProvider with the mock theme.
  render(
    <ThemeProvider theme={mockTheme}>
      <CustomButton />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );

  const button = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /special button/i });

  // 3. Assert that the component has rendered with the style derived from the mock theme.
  expect(button).toHaveStyle('background-color: rgb(255, 0, 0)');
});


This pattern ensures that component tests are self-contained and do not depend on the application's global theme, making them more robust and less prone to breaking from unrelated changes.

Vitest - Maturing Mocking for a Type-Safe, Modular World

Vitest's evolution reflects the broader maturation of the JavaScript ecosystem, particularly its firm embrace of ES Modules (ESM) and TypeScript. The challenges of mocking in an asynchronous, statically-analyzed module system have led to the establishment of a new standard mocking pattern. This pattern, centered around vi.mock with an async factory and vi.importActual, is not merely a new feature but a necessary solution to preserve the type safety that developers now consider essential. As Vitest heads towards its v4.0 release, it continues to refine its APIs to make mocking more intuitive and powerful, ensuring it remains a first-class testing framework for modern, type-safe applications.

Quick-Reference: Core Updates & Modern Mocking

Path to v4.0: Vitest is in an active beta cycle for its next major version, v4.0. This release is slated to include breaking changes aimed at improving the developer experience, such as a rewrite of the spying implementation to make module mocking more intuitive and less error-prone.37
Deprecation of workspace: The workspace configuration option has been deprecated. It is replaced by the more flexible and explicit projects option, which provides better support for monorepo configurations by allowing for distinct test settings per project.39
New Standard for Mocking ES Modules: The established best practice for mocking ES Modules in Vitest involves using vi.mock in combination with an async factory function. This factory uses vi.importActual to retrieve the original module, allowing for type-safe partial mocking where only specific exports are replaced while others retain their original implementation. This pattern elegantly handles the asynchronous nature of ESM while fully integrating with TypeScript's type system.40
Replaces: Older, more complex patterns that often struggled with ESM's asynchronous loading, sometimes forcing developers to mock entire modules or sacrifice type safety, leading to brittle tests.

Implementation: Advanced Mocking Techniques

The following examples demonstrate the modern, type-safe patterns for mocking modules in Vitest.

Type-Safe Partial Mocking of an ES Module

This pattern is the cornerstone of modern mocking in Vitest. It allows a test to override a single function from a module while retaining the original implementations of all other functions, all with full TypeScript support.

TypeScript


// utils/auth.ts
export const getUser = async (id: string) => {
  //... fetches user from an API
  return { id, name: 'Real User' };
};

export const hasPermission = (user: { name: string }, permission: string) => {
  //... complex permission logic
  return user.name === 'Real User';
};

// __tests__/someComponent.test.ts
import { vi } from 'vitest';
import { hasPermission } from '@/utils/auth'; // Import the real function for spying/assertion
import type * as AuthModule from '@/utils/auth'; // Import the module type

// 1. Mock the module using its path.
vi.mock('@/utils/auth', async (importOriginal) => {
  // 2. Use `importActual` with a type assertion to get the original module and its types.
  const actual = await importOriginal<typeof AuthModule>();

  // 3. Return a new module object, spreading the actual module and overriding only what's needed.
  return {
   ...actual,
    getUser: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({ id: '123', name: 'Mocked User' }), // Replace getUser
    // `hasPermission` remains the original implementation.
  };
});

test('should use mocked user but real permission logic', async () => {
  // The mocked version of getUser is imported automatically.
  const { getUser } = await import('@/utils/auth');

  const user = await getUser('123');

  expect(user.name).toBe('Mocked User');

  // The real `hasPermission` function is used, which will now fail because the user is mocked.
  const canEdit = hasPermission(user, 'edit');
  expect(canEdit).toBe(false);

  // We can also assert that our mock was called.
  expect(vi.mocked(getUser)).toHaveBeenCalledWith('123');
});


This approach is powerful because it is both precise and type-safe. The use of importOriginal<typeof AuthModule>() ensures that the actual object is correctly typed, providing autocompletion and preventing type errors within the mock factory.40

Mocking with vi.hoisted

Because vi.mock calls are hoisted (statically moved to the top of the file by the test runner), they cannot reference variables declared in the test's scope. The vi.hoisted utility provides a workaround for this.

TypeScript


// __tests__/hoisted.test.ts
import { vi } from 'vitest';

// 1. Define mock functions inside `vi.hoisted`.
// These variables will be hoisted along with vi.mock.
const mocks = vi.hoisted(() => {
  return {
    mockedGetUser: vi.fn(),
  };
});

// 2. Reference the hoisted mocks inside the vi.mock factory.
vi.mock('@/utils/auth', () => ({
  getUser: mocks.mockedGetUser,
}));

test('should use hoisted mock function', async () => {
  const { getUser } = await import('@/utils/auth');

  mocks.mockedGetUser.mockResolvedValue({ name: 'Hoisted Mock User' });

  const user = await getUser('456');

  expect(user.name).toBe('Hoisted Mock User');
  expect(mocks.mockedGetUser).toHaveBeenCalledWith('456');
});


This technique is essential when the mock implementation needs to be referenced or modified across multiple tests within the same file.42

Integrated Testing Strategies

A robust testing strategy involves applying these advanced mocking techniques to the specific libraries and frameworks used in an application. The following summarizes the recommended mocking patterns for the stack covered in this report.
Mocking a Drizzle Client: The most effective strategy is to mock the database connection module in a global setup file (vitest.setup.ts). This mock should replace the production database driver with an in-memory alternative like pglite. The setup should also use drizzle-kit/api to apply migrations, ensuring that tests run against a schema that is identical to production, but in a fast, isolated, in-memory environment. This provides high-fidelity integration testing for the data layer.11
Mocking a Supabase Client: Testing Supabase interactions requires two distinct strategies:
For Server Components/Actions: The Supabase server client relies on next/headers to read authentication cookies. In a test environment, next/headers must be mocked to provide a fake cookie store. This allows the server client to be instantiated and its methods (e.g., auth.getUser) to be subsequently mocked to simulate different user states.17
For Client Components: The Supabase browser client module should be mocked to control the return values of methods like auth.getSession. This allows tests to simulate authenticated or unauthenticated user sessions, enabling verification of conditional rendering and UI behavior.18
Mocking Next.js Server Actions: Server Actions should be tested by mocking the module where the action is defined. This allows a test to simulate a user interaction (like a form submission) and assert that the correct action was called with the expected payload (FormData). The internal dependencies of the Server Action, such as database clients or external service calls, should also be mocked to test the action's logic in isolation.31
