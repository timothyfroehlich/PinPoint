# Index of docs/orchestrator-system

This directory contains documentation related to the orchestrator system for the PinPoint application. It outlines the design and implementation of various agents and their roles within the automated development workflow, providing insights into how tasks are managed and executed.

- **[agent-workspace.md](./agent-workspace.md)**: This document describes the concept and structure of an agent's workspace within the orchestrator system. It details how individual agents operate in isolated environments, manage their code, and interact with the broader development ecosystem. Understanding the agent workspace is crucial for comprehending the parallel execution capabilities of the orchestrator.
- **[implementation-agent-project.md](./implementation-agent-project.md)**: This document outlines the project and responsibilities of the implementation agent. It details how this agent is designed to autonomously write and modify code based on given tasks, adhering to project conventions and quality standards. This provides insight into the automated code generation and modification processes within the orchestrator system.
- **[NOTES_FOR_THE_ORCHESTRATOR_TASK.md](./NOTES_FOR_THE_ORCHESTRATOR_TASK.md)**: This file contains specific notes and considerations for the orchestrator task itself. It might include details about the orchestrator's internal logic, decision-making processes, or any unique challenges encountered during its development. This serves as a supplementary document for understanding the nuances of the orchestrator's operation.
- **[ORCHESTRATOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md](./ORCHESTRATOR_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md)**: This document contains the system prompt used to initialize and guide the orchestrator. It defines the orchestrator's core directives, constraints, and overall mission, shaping its behavior and decision-making processes. This prompt is fundamental to understanding the orchestrator's operational framework.
- **[orchestrator-project.md](./orchestrator-project.md)**: This document provides an overview of the orchestrator project, detailing its goals, architecture, and overall design. It explains how the orchestrator coordinates various agents to achieve complex development tasks, acting as the central intelligence for the automated software engineering process. This is a foundational document for understanding the entire orchestrator system.
- **[review-agent-project.md](./review-agent-project.md)**: This document describes the project and responsibilities of the review agent. It details how this agent is designed to analyze code changes, identify potential issues, and ensure adherence to coding standards and best practices. This provides insight into the automated code review and quality assurance processes within the orchestrator system.
- **[test-agent-project.md](./test-agent-project.md)**: This document outlines the project and responsibilities of the test agent. It details how this agent is designed to generate and execute tests, verify code functionality, and ensure the overall stability and correctness of the software. This provides insight into the automated testing and quality verification processes within the orchestrator system.
- **[multi-agent-development-workflow.md](./multi-agent-development-workflow.md)**: Comprehensive patterns and insights from coordinated multi-agent development using git worktrees. Documents parallel development strategies, conflict resolution patterns, quality gate enforcement, and asynchronous coordination techniques. Contains counter-intuitive discoveries about shared database benefits, worktree complexity trade-offs, and agent self-sufficiency principles. Moved from lessons-learned as foundational orchestrator system documentation.
