# Parallel Execution Guide

## Execution Timeline

### Sequential Phases

1. **Phase 1** (Core Database) - MUST be completed first
2. **Phase 2** (Service Layer) - Depends on Phase 1

### Parallel Execution Groups

#### Group A (After Phase 1 & 2 Complete)

Can be done by separate subagents simultaneously:

- **3.1** API Routes Refactoring
- **3.2** Auth Configuration Refactoring
- **3.3** tRPC Routers Service Usage
- **4** Testing Infrastructure

#### Group B (After Phase 4 Complete)

- **5** Update Individual Test Files (can be split among multiple agents)

## Recommended Agent Assignments

### Critical Path (1 Agent)

- Phase 1 → Phase 2

### Parallel Work (3-4 Agents)

After Phase 2:

- Agent A: Phase 3.1 (API Routes)
- Agent B: Phase 3.2 (Auth Config)
- Agent C: Phase 3.3 (tRPC Routers)
- Agent D: Phase 4 (Testing Infrastructure)

### Test Updates (4 Agents)

After Phase 4, can run in parallel:

- Agent E: Phase 5.1 (API Route Tests)
- Agent F: Phase 5.2 (Auth Tests)
- Agent G: Phase 5.3 (Router Tests)
- Agent H: Phase 5.4 (Service Tests)

## Branch Strategy

### Main Feature Branch

- `feature/di-refactor`

### Sub-branches for Parallel Work

Phase 3 & 4:

- `feature/di-refactor-api-routes`
- `feature/di-refactor-auth`
- `feature/di-refactor-routers`
- `feature/di-refactor-testing`

Phase 5:

- `feature/di-refactor-test-api`
- `feature/di-refactor-test-auth`
- `feature/di-refactor-test-routers`
- `feature/di-refactor-test-services`

### Merge Order

1. Phase 1 → main feature branch
2. Phase 2 → main feature branch
3. All Phase 3 sub-branches → main feature branch (any order)
4. Phase 4 → main feature branch
5. Phase 5 changes → main feature branch

## Communication Points

### After Phase 1

- Confirm database module exports
- Share any type changes

### After Phase 2

- Confirm context interface
- Share service factory method names

### After Phase 3

- Confirm all imports resolved
- Share any pattern discoveries

### After Phase 4

- Share test helper patterns
- Confirm mock structures

## Risk Mitigation

- Each phase has clear acceptance criteria
- Type checking ensures interface compatibility
- Can test each phase independently
- Rollback strategy: revert to direct imports
