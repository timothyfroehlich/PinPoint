# Rejected Migration Approaches

This directory contains migration approaches that were considered but ultimately rejected in favor of better strategies.

## Why These Were Rejected

### Big Bang Approach (`big-bang-approach.md`)

The original migration plan proposed an aggressive "all at once" approach:

- Delete all tests and rewrite from scratch
- Remove service factories entirely
- Migrate everything in one massive change

**Rejected because:** Too risky, no rollback safety, would break production.

### Early Discussions (`migration-discussions.md`)

Initial exploration of Supabase features and benefits. Contains valuable learning but includes some misconceptions that were later corrected.

**Archived because:** Superseded by more informed technical analysis.

## Current Approach

The active migration uses a direct conversion approach optimized for solo development velocity. See [Active Migration Plan](../../migration/supabase-drizzle/).
