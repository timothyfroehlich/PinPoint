# Future Ideas

Quick capture of ideas for future consideration.

## Permission System Enhancements

### Location-Scoped Permissions

- Add permission scoping by location (e.g., `machine:edit:own-location`)
- Useful for multi-location organizations with location managers
- Would allow granular control without full admin access

### Machine Owner Special Permissions

- Machine owners could have enhanced permissions for their own machines
- Override role-based permissions for owned equipment
- Encourage ownership and responsibility
