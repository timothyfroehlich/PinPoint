## 2. React Compiler Architecture

### Core React Compiler Integration

**Build-Time Optimization Foundation**
- React Compiler provides automatic memoization without manual intervention through build-time code transformation
- Eliminates need for manual `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and `React.memo` patterns while maintaining optimal performance
- Analyzes component dependencies at build time and generates optimized code with runtime checks using `react/compiler-runtime`
- Only optimizes code that follows React's rules, safely skipping problematic components rather than failing builds

**Server Components Optimization Strategy**
- Perfect compatibility with Next.js 15 Server Components enabling automatic memoization of server-side data fetching
- Optimized component rendering on both server and client with intelligent caching strategies
- Compatible with async Server Components patterns and request-level memoization using React 19 cache() API
- Hybrid architecture support optimizing both server data fetching and client interactivity boundaries

### Automatic Performance Optimization Patterns

**Request-Level Memoization Integration**
- Seamless integration with React 19 cache() API for request-scoped caching in Server Components
- Eliminates duplicate database queries within single request lifecycle through compiler-generated cache wrappers
- Memory-efficient query patterns with automatic cleanup after request completion perfect for SSR environments
- Performance benefits include re-render prevention, computation memoization, and optimized memory management

**Intelligent Code Generation**
```typescript
// Compiler automatically transforms this:
function ExpensiveComponent({ organizationId }) {
  const processedData = heavyComputation(organizationId);
  return <div>{processedData}</div>;
}

// Into optimized version with runtime memoization:
function ExpensiveComponent({ organizationId }) {
  const $ = _c(2);
  let processedData;
  if ($[0] !== organizationId) {
    processedData = heavyComputation(organizationId);
    $[0] = organizationId;
    $[1] = processedData;
  } else {
    processedData = $[1];
  }
  return <div>{processedData}</div>;
}
```

### Build Integration and Configuration

**Next.js 15 Configuration Architecture**
```javascript
// next.config.js - React Compiler integration
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    reactCompiler: true, // Enable automatic optimization
  },
};
```

**Production-Safe Compilation Strategy**
- `panicThreshold: 'none'` configuration skips problematic components instead of failing builds
- Selective compilation using `compilationMode: 'annotation'` for controlled rollout and gradual adoption
- Directory-based compilation control enabling phased deployment and feature flag integration
- Comprehensive error logging and monitoring integration for production deployment validation

### Development Experience and Debugging

**Three-Tiered Debugging Architecture**
- Build-time errors indicate severe Rules of React violations requiring immediate attention
- Runtime behavioral changes often reveal subtle Rules of React violations requiring investigation
- Performance monitoring tracks over-memoization cases and bundle size impact for optimization decisions

**Debugging Tools and Escape Hatches**
```javascript
// Temporary debugging escape hatch
function ProblematicComponent() {
  "use no memo"; // Disable compilation for debugging
  // Component implementation
}

// Detailed logging configuration
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    ['babel-plugin-react-compiler', {
      logger: {
        logEvent(filename, event) {
          if (event.kind === 'CompileError') {
            console.error(`Compilation failed: ${filename}`);
            console.error(`Reason: ${event.detail.reason}`);
          }
        }
      }
    }]
  ]
};
```

### TypeScript Integration and Compatibility

**Full TypeScript Support Architecture**
- Seamless integration with TypeScript strictest configuration without requiring code changes
- Automatic type inference preservation while adding memoization optimizations
- Compatible with complex generic types and discriminated unions used throughout the codebase
- Type-safe optimization ensuring no runtime type errors introduced through compilation

**Component Type Preservation**
```typescript
interface ComplexProps {
  organizationId: string;
  onUpdate: (data: ComplexData) => Promise<void>;
  filters: IssueFilters;
}

// Compiler preserves all type information while optimizing
function TypedComponent({ organizationId, onUpdate, filters }: ComplexProps) {
  // Automatic optimization without losing type safety
  const processedData = processComplexData(organizationId, filters);
  return <ComplexUI data={processedData} onUpdate={onUpdate} />;
}
```

### Performance Monitoring and Bundle Impact

**Bundle Size Analysis and Management**
- Compiler runtime adds approximately 1.11kB to bundle size for memoization infrastructure
- Potential bundle reduction through elimination of manual memoization patterns
- Net bundle impact depends on existing memoization patterns and can be monitored through build analytics
- Selective compilation strategies available for bundle size optimization when needed

**Performance Metrics Integration**
```typescript
// Track compiler impact on performance
function trackCompilerMetrics() {
  performance.mark('component-render-start');
  // Component rendering with compiler optimizations
  performance.mark('component-render-end');

  const measure = performance.measure(
    'component-render',
    'component-render-start',
    'component-render-end'
  );

  // Monitor compiler performance impact
  reportMetrics('react-compiler', measure.duration);
}
```

### Error Handling and Production Resilience

**Comprehensive Error Architecture**
- Build-time error handling with graceful fallback to unoptimized code when compilation fails
- Runtime error boundaries specifically designed to handle compiler-related issues
- Production error monitoring with correlation IDs for tracking compiler-related runtime issues
- Automatic rollback mechanisms for problematic component optimizations in production

**Error Monitoring Integration**
```typescript
// Production error boundary for compiler issues
function CompilerErrorBoundary({ children }) {
  return (
    <ErrorBoundary
      FallbackComponent={ErrorFallback}
      onError={(error, errorInfo) => {
        if (error.message.includes('compiler-runtime')) {
          reportCompilerIssue(error, errorInfo, {
            context: 'compiler-optimization',
            severity: 'medium'
          });
        }
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </ErrorBoundary>
  );
}
```

### Production Deployment Strategy

**Incremental Adoption Architecture**
- Phase 1: Annotation mode with feature flags for controlled component-level rollout
- Phase 2: Directory-based compilation enabling module-level optimization deployment
- Phase 3: Full inference mode with comprehensive monitoring and automatic fallback capabilities
- Rollback readiness with immediate compilation disable capability for emergency situations

**Feature Flag Integration**
```typescript
// Production-ready feature flag implementation
export function shouldUseReactCompiler(): boolean {
  return (
    process.env.REACT_COMPILER_ENABLED === 'true' &&
    !isBot(navigator.userAgent) && // Skip optimization for bots
    Math.random() < parseFloat(process.env.COMPILER_ROLLOUT_PERCENTAGE || '0.5')
  );
}
```

- Performance improvements that enhance rather than compromise multi-tenant security architecture

## 3. Authentication & Session Management

### Core Authentication Architecture

**Four-Layer Authentication Stack**
- **Layer 1**: Supabase SSR foundation with @supabase/ssr client management
- **Layer 2**: Next.js middleware for automatic token refresh and session synchronization
- **Layer 3**: Application authentication context (tRPC procedures, Server Actions)
- **Layer 4**: Multi-tenant organization scoping with automatic context resolution

**Session Management Pattern**
- Mandatory Next.js middleware for token refresh using createServerClient from @supabase/ssr
- Cookie synchronization using required getAll()/setAll() pattern (never individual cookie operations)
- Chunked cookie management for large sessions with automatic cleanup
- Request-level authentication caching using React 19 cache() API

### User Journey Authentication Flows

**Anonymous to Authenticated Transition**
- OAuth provider integration with mandatory auth callback route at /auth/callback
- Registration flow with automatic organization assignment via app_metadata
- Email verification with seamless redirect handling across development and production environments
- Progressive user profile completion with organization context establishment

**Organization Context Resolution**
- Subdomain-based tenant identification with automatic organization mapping
- User app_metadata storage for secure organization assignment (admin-controlled, not user-editable)
- Organization membership validation with role-based access control integration
- Automatic context repair for users with broken or missing organization associations

### Server-Side Rendering Authentication Patterns

**Supabase SSR Client Configuration**
- Server Components use createServerClient with proper cookie handling for read operations
- Browser Components use createBrowserClient for interactive authentication flows
- Server Actions implement authentication validation with form processing and revalidation
- Error boundaries handle authentication failures with appropriate redirects

**Cookie Handling and Security**
- Mandatory getAll()/setAll() cookie pattern prevents session desynchronization
- Secure cookie configuration with proper domain, path, and security flags
- Session persistence across server/client boundaries with automatic refresh
- Protection against cookie injection and session fixation attacks

### Multi-Tenant Authentication Architecture

**Organization Scoping Enforcement**
- User app_metadata contains secure tenant_id assignment managed by admin functions only
- Organization context propagation through Server Components and Server Actions
- RLS helper functions extract tenant context from JWT tokens for database policy enforcement
- Automatic scoping validation ensures users can only access their organization's resources

**Role-Based Access Control Integration**
- User roles stored in app_metadata with organization-scoped permissions
- Permission checking at application layer before database access
- Role hierarchy enforcement (owner > admin > technician > member)
- Permission inheritance and delegation patterns for organizational flexibility

### Performance and Security Optimizations

**Request-Level Authentication Caching**
- React 19 cache() API wrapper for getUser() calls preventing duplicate authentication requests
- Shared authentication context across Server Components within single request lifecycle
- Optimized auth checks with early returns for unauthenticated states
- Memory-efficient session validation with automatic cleanup

**Security Boundaries and Validation**
- Authentication verification required for all protected routes and API endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization for all authentication-related form submissions
- Secure redirect handling with whitelist validation and origin verification
- Session integrity checks with automatic logout on suspicious activity

### RSC Migration Authentication Patterns

**Server Component Authentication**
- Direct Supabase client usage in Server Components with async/await patterns
- Authentication prop passing from authenticated layout components to child components
- Organization context injection at layout level for automatic scoping
- Error handling with appropriate fallback states and redirect flows

**Client Island Authentication Boundaries**
- Minimal Client Components for interactive authentication features (login forms, profile updates)
- Server-passed authentication props to client islands for secure context sharing
- Hybrid authentication patterns combining server validation with client interactivity
- Progressive enhancement ensuring core functionality works without JavaScript

**Server Actions Authentication Integration**
- Form-based authentication flows with proper validation and error handling
- Background authentication processing with revalidatePath and redirect patterns
- Integration with data mutation workflows requiring authentication context
- Type-safe authentication context propagation through Server Action parameters

## 4. Organization Context Resolution
### Global (Root/Apex) Context

If no subdomain is present, the route operates in global context. No organization membership lookup or org-scoped queries should be performed. Only public/global data may be accessed. Org-scoped functions must assert presence of organizationId and fail loudly if absent.

### Multi-Tenant Organization Context Architecture

**Request-Time Organization Resolution Strategy**
- Subdomain-based tenant identification with automatic organization mapping for pre-authentication context establishment
- DNS-based tenant isolation providing inherent security boundaries and simplified routing without manual tenant filtering
- Wildcard subdomain architecture enabling scalable multi-tenant deployment with automatic certificate management
- Request-level organization context binding through Next.js middleware with header-based context propagation

**Advanced Subdomain-Based Resolution Patterns**
```typescript
// middleware.ts - Extract organization from subdomain
export async function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  const host = request.headers.get('host')
  const subdomain = host?.split('.')[0]

  // Set organization context in request headers
  const requestHeaders = new Headers(request.headers)
  requestHeaders.set('x-organization-context', subdomain || 'default')

  return NextResponse.next({
    request: { headers: requestHeaders }
  })
}
```

### React 19 Cache Integration for Context Resolution

**Request-Scoped Organization Context Caching**
```typescript
import { cache } from 'react'

// Request-scoped organization resolution with React 19 cache API
export const getOrganizationContext = cache(async () => {
  const headers = await import('next/headers')
  const orgContext = (await headers.headers()).get('x-organization-context')

  if (!orgContext) {
    throw new OrganizationContextError('No organization context found')
  }

  return await validateAndResolveOrganization(orgContext)
})

// Cached organization-aware data fetching
export const getOrganizationData = cache(async (orgId: string) => {
  return await db.query.issues.findMany({
    where: eq(issues.organizationId, orgId)
  })
})
```

**Performance Benefits of Request-Level Memoization**
- Eliminates duplicate authentication queries within single request lifecycle
- Organization context resolved once per request with automatic cache invalidation between requests
- Database query deduplication preventing N+1 organization validation patterns
- Memory-efficient context management with automatic cleanup after request completion

### Supabase SSR Integration with Organization Context

**Enhanced Authentication with Organization Binding**
```typescript
import { createServerClient } from '@supabase/ssr'

export async function createOrganizationAwareClient() {
  const cookies = await import('next/headers').then(m => m.cookies())

  const supabase = createServerClient(
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL!,
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY!,
    {
      cookies: {
        getAll() { return cookies.getAll() },
        setAll(cookiesToSet) {
          cookiesToSet.forEach(({ name, value, options }) => {
            cookies.set(name, value, options)
          })
        },
      },
    }
  )

  const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
  const organizationId = user?.app_metadata?.organizationId

  if (!organizationId) {
    throw new OrganizationContextError('User lacks organization context')
  }

  return { supabase, organizationId, user }
}
```

**JWT-Based Organization Context Security**
- Organization assignment stored in app_metadata field controlled exclusively by service role preventing user tampering
- RLS policies automatically read organization context from JWT tokens for database-level enforcement
- Multi-organization user membership support with role-specific permissions per organizational context
- Automatic context validation and repair mechanisms for users with broken organization associations

### Server Components Organization Scoping

**Next.js 15 Server Components with Organization Context**
```typescript
// Server Component with organization scoping
export default async function IssuesPage() {
  const { organizationId } = await getOrganizationContext()
  const issues = await getOrganizationData(organizationId)

  return <IssuesList issues={issues} />
}

// Context propagation through component hierarchy
export default async function OrganizationLayout({
  children
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  const { organization, user } = await getOrganizationContext()

  return (
    <div>
      <OrganizationHeader organization={organization} />
      <OrganizationProvider organizationId={organization.id}>
        {children}
      </OrganizationProvider>
    </div>
  )
}
```

**Client Island Integration for Organization-Aware Interactions**
```typescript
'use client'
export function OrganizationProvider({
  children,
  organizationId
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
  organizationId: string
}) {
  const [orgContext] = useState(organizationId)

  return (
    <OrganizationContext.Provider value={orgContext}>
      {children}
    </OrganizationContext.Provider>
  )
}
```

### Database Query Scoping and RLS Integration

**Hybrid RLS Approach for Multi-Tenant Security**
```sql
-- Organization-scoped RLS policy
CREATE POLICY tenant_isolation ON issues
  FOR ALL
  TO authenticated
  USING (organization_id = current_setting('app.current_organization_id'));

ALTER TABLE issues ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

**Application-Layer Enhancement with Drizzle Integration**
```typescript
// Drizzle with organization context binding
export async function withOrgRLS<T>(
  db: DrizzleClient,
  organizationId: string,
  fn: (tx: DrizzleClient) => Promise<T>
): Promise<T> {
  return await db.transaction(async (tx) => {
    // Bind organization context for RLS
    await tx.execute(
      sql.raw(`SET LOCAL app.current_organization_id = '${organizationId.replace(/'/g, "''")}'`)
    )
    return await fn(tx)
  })
}
```

### Security Boundaries and Multi-Organization Management

**Defense-in-Depth Organization Validation**
```typescript
export async function validateOrganizationAccess(
  userId: string,
  requestedOrgId: string
): Promise<OrganizationContext> {
  // Multi-layer validation pipeline
  const membership = await db.query.memberships.findFirst({
    where: and(
      eq(memberships.user_id, userId),
      eq(memberships.organization_id, requestedOrgId)
    )
  })

  if (!membership) {
    throw new UnauthorizedError('No membership found')
  }

  const organization = await db.query.organizations.findFirst({
    where: eq(organizations.id, requestedOrgId)
  })

  if (!organization?.is_active) {
    throw new OrganizationSuspendedError('Organization inactive')
  }

  return { organization, membership }
}
```

**Multi-Organization User Membership Handling**
```typescript
// Organization switching with subdomain-based routing
export async function switchOrganization(
  userId: string,
  targetOrgId: string
): Promise<{ redirectUrl: string }> {
  await validateOrganizationAccess(userId, targetOrgId)
  await updateUserOrganization(userId, targetOrgId)

  const org = await getOrganization(targetOrgId)
  const redirectUrl = `https://${org.subdomain}.${process.env.BASE_DOMAIN}`

  return { redirectUrl }
}
```

### Context Repair and Error Recovery Architecture

**Graceful Context Recovery Mechanisms**
```typescript
export async function repairOrganizationContext(
  user: User
): Promise<OrganizationContext | null> {
  try {
    // Try current app_metadata first
    const orgId = user.app_metadata?.organizationId
    if (orgId) {
      const context = await validateOrganizationAccess(user.id, orgId)
      return context
    }

    // Find user's default organization
    const defaultMembership = await db.query.memberships.findFirst({
      where: and(
        eq(memberships.user_id, user.id),
        eq(memberships.is_active, true)
      ),
      orderBy: desc(memberships.created_at)
    })

    if (defaultMembership) {
      await updateUserOrganization(user.id, defaultMembership.organization_id)
      return await validateOrganizationAccess(user.id, defaultMembership.organization_id)
    }

    return null
  } catch (error) {
    console.warn('Context repair failed:', error)
    return null
  }
}
```

**Progressive Degradation for Context Failures**
```typescript
export async function getOrganizationContextWithFallback(): Promise<OrganizationContext | null> {
  try {
    return await getOrganizationContext()
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof OrganizationContextError) {
      const user = await getCurrentUser()
      if (user) {
        return await repairOrganizationContext(user)
      }
    }

    console.error('Organization context resolution failed:', error)
    return null
  }
}
```

### Performance Optimization and Monitoring

**Request-Level Performance Patterns**
- React 19 cache() API eliminates duplicate organization resolution queries within single request
- Connection pool optimization with organization context persistence across connection reuse
- Strategic organization context propagation minimizing validation overhead while maintaining security
- Database query optimization with organization-first filtering and proper indexing strategies

**Organization Context Monitoring Integration**
```typescript
// Track organization context resolution performance
export async function monitoredOrganizationResolution(
  requestId: string
): Promise<OrganizationContext> {
  const startTime = performance.now()

  try {
    const context = await getOrganizationContext()

    const duration = performance.now() - startTime
    trackMetric('organization_context_resolution', duration, {
      requestId,
      organizationId: context.organization.id,
      success: true
    })

    return context
  } catch (error) {
    const duration = performance.now() - startTime
    trackMetric('organization_context_resolution', duration, {
      requestId,
      success: false,
      error: error.message
    })
    throw error
  }
}
```

- Server Components handle authentication validation, data fetching, and initial rendering server-side
- Client Components ("use client") limited to specific interactivity boundaries requiring user interaction

**Page Component Architecture**
- Route entry points perform server-side authentication checks using `getSupabaseUser()` before rendering
- Server Components execute redirect logic and error handling at the route level
- Metadata generation handled server-side with `generateMetadata` functions for SEO optimization
- Server pages pass server-fetched data as props to child components for optimal performance

### Client Island Architecture

## 6. Advanced Error Handling

### Multi-Layer Error Classification and Propagation

**Type-Safe Error Classification Architecture**
```typescript
// ~/lib/types/errors.ts - Comprehensive error classification system
export const ErrorSeverity = {
  LOW: 'low',
  MEDIUM: 'medium',
  HIGH: 'high',
  CRITICAL: 'critical'
} as const

export type ErrorSeverity = typeof ErrorSeverity[keyof typeof ErrorSeverity]

export interface ClassifiedError {
  type: 'validation' | 'authorization' | 'database' | 'external' | 'system'
  severity: ErrorSeverity
  userMessage: string
  internalMessage: string
  context?: Record<string, unknown>
  organizationId?: string
}

// Security-conscious error classes
export class ValidationError extends Error implements ClassifiedError {
  readonly type = 'validation'
  readonly severity = ErrorSeverity.LOW

  constructor(
    public readonly userMessage: string,
    public readonly internalMessage: string = userMessage,
    public readonly context?: Record<string, unknown>
  ) {
    super(internalMessage)
    this.name = 'ValidationError'
  }
}

export class AuthorizationError extends Error implements ClassifiedError {
  readonly type = 'authorization'
  readonly severity = ErrorSeverity.HIGH
  readonly userMessage = 'Access denied'

  constructor(
    public readonly internalMessage: string,
    public readonly organizationId?: string,
    public readonly context?: Record<string, unknown>
  ) {
    super(internalMessage)
    this.name = 'AuthorizationError'
  }
}
```

**Multi-Layer Error Propagation Strategy**

- Layer 3: Database constraint enforcement with transaction rollback and retry mechanisms
- Layer 4: External service integration with circuit breaker patterns and graceful degradation
- Layer 5: System-level error boundaries with monitoring integration and automatic recovery attempts

### Server Components Error Boundary Architecture

**Hybrid Server/Client Error Handling Pattern**
```typescript
// Global error boundary for unhandled server errors
export default function GlobalError({
  error,
  reset,
}: {
  error: Error & { digest?: string }
  reset: () => void
}) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <div className="error-fallback">
          <h2>Something went wrong!</h2>
          {process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && (
            <pre className="error-details">{error.message}</pre>
          )}
          <button onClick={() => reset()}>Try again</button>
        </div>
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}

// Progressive error boundaries at multiple levels
async function ServerDataComponent({ orgId }: { orgId: string }) {
  try {
    const data = await getOrganizationData(orgId)
    return <ClientErrorBoundary data={data} />
  } catch (error) {
    return <ErrorFallback message="Unable to load data" />
  }
}
```

**Client Island Error Integration**
```typescript
'use client'
function ClientErrorBoundary({ data }: { data: any }) {
  const [error, setError] = useState<Error | null>(null)

  if (error) {
    return (
      <div className="error-boundary">
        <h3>Something went wrong</h3>
        <button onClick={() => setError(null)}>Retry</button>
        <button onClick={() => window.location.reload()}>Refresh Page</button>
      </div>
    )
  }

  return <DataDisplay data={data} onError={setError} />
}
```

### Server Actions Error Handling and User Feedback

**React 19 useActionState Integration Pattern**
```typescript
'use server'
export async function createIssue(
  prevState: any,
  formData: FormData
): Promise<{ message?: string; errors?: Record<string, string[]> }> {
  // Security-conscious input validation
  const validatedFields = createIssueSchema.safeParse({
    title: formData.get('title'),
    organizationId: formData.get('organizationId'),
  })

  if (!validatedFields.success) {
    return {
      errors: validatedFields.error.flatten().fieldErrors,
      message: 'Invalid input provided',
    }
  }

  try {
    // Organization-scoped operation with error handling
    await createIssueForOrganization(validatedFields.data)
    redirect('/issues')
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof DatabaseError) {
      console.error('Database error:', error) // Server-side logging only
      return { message: 'Unable to create issue. Please try again.' }
    }

    if (error instanceof AuthorizationError) {
      return { message: 'You do not have permission to perform this action.' }
    }

    // Generic fallback prevents information disclosure
    return { message: 'An unexpected error occurred.' }
  }
}
```

**Enhanced Form Error Handling with Progressive Enhancement**
```typescript
'use client'
export function CreateIssueForm() {
  const [state, formAction, pending] = useActionState(createIssue, { message: '' })

  return (
    <form action={formAction}>
      <input name="title" required />
      {state?.errors?.title && (
        <div className="field-error" role="alert" aria-live="polite">
          {state.errors.title.join(', ')}
        </div>
      )}

      {state?.message && (
        <div className="form-error" role="alert" aria-live="polite">
          {state.message}
        </div>
      )}

      <button disabled={pending} type="submit">
        {pending ? 'Creating...' : 'Create Issue'}
      </button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

### Security-Conscious Error Messaging

**Production Error Sanitization Architecture**
```typescript
// ~/lib/errors/error-sanitizer.ts
export function sanitizeErrorForClient(error: unknown): {
  message: string
  code?: string
  digest?: string
} {
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
    // Full error details in development
    return {
      message: error instanceof Error ? error.message : 'Unknown error',
      code: error instanceof ClassifiedError ? error.type : undefined,
    }
  }

  // Production: only safe, generic messages
  if (error instanceof ValidationError) {
    return { message: error.userMessage }
  }

  if (error instanceof AuthorizationError) {
    return {
      message: error.userMessage,
      code: 'authorization_error'
    }
  }

  if (error instanceof DatabaseError) {
    return {
      message: 'A system error occurred. Please try again later.',
      digest: generateErrorDigest(error) // For log correlation
    }
  }

  // Generic fallback prevents information leakage
  return {
    message: 'An unexpected error occurred.',
    digest: generateErrorDigest(error)
  }
}

function generateErrorDigest(error: unknown): string {
  const errorString = error instanceof Error ? error.stack : String(error)
  return crypto.createHash('sha256').update(errorString).digest('hex').slice(0, 8)
}
```

**Multi-Tenant Error Context Isolation**
- Organization-scoped error logging preventing cross-tenant information leakage
- Error context sanitization removing sensitive organizational data from client responses
- Audit trail generation for security events while protecting organizational boundaries
- Error correlation across organizational boundaries for system-wide issue detection while maintaining data isolation

### Database Error Handling and Transaction Safety

**Transaction Wrapper with Retry Logic**
```typescript
// ~/lib/dal/transaction-wrapper.ts
export async function safeTransaction<T>(
  operation: (tx: typeof db) => Promise<T>,
  options: {
    organizationId: string
    maxRetries?: number
    backoffMs?: number
  }
): Promise<{ data?: T; error?: ClassifiedError }> {
  const { organizationId, maxRetries = 3, backoffMs = 1000 } = options

  for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      const data = await db.transaction(async (tx) => {
        // Verify organization context within transaction
        await verifyOrganizationAccess(tx, organizationId)
        return await operation(tx)
      })

      return { data }
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(`Transaction attempt ${attempt} failed:`, {
        error: error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error),
        organizationId,
        attempt
      })

      if (isDatabaseConstraintError(error)) {
        if (attempt === maxRetries) {
          return {
            error: new DatabaseError(
              'Database operation failed after retries',
              error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error),
              { organizationId, attempts: maxRetries }
            )
          }
        }

        // Exponential backoff before retry
        await new Promise(resolve =>
          setTimeout(resolve, backoffMs * Math.pow(2, attempt - 1))
        )
        continue
      }

      // Non-retryable error
      return {
        error: error instanceof ClassifiedError
          ? error
          : new DatabaseError('Unexpected database error', String(error), { organizationId })
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### TypeScript Strictest Error Handling Patterns

**Type-Safe Error Guards and Validation**
```typescript
// ~/lib/types/guards.ts - Strict type validation for error handling
export function isValidOrganizationContext(
  context: unknown
): context is { organizationId: string; userId: string } {
  return (
    typeof context === 'object' &&
    context !== null &&
    'organizationId' in context &&
    'userId' in context &&
    typeof (context as any).organizationId === 'string' &&
    typeof (context as any).userId === 'string' &&
    (context as any).organizationId.length > 0 &&
    (context as any).userId.length > 0
  )
}

// Safe operation wrapper with comprehensive error handling
export async function safeOrganizationOperation<T>(
  context: unknown,
  operation: (ctx: { organizationId: string; userId: string }) => Promise<T>
): Promise<{ data?: T; error?: ClassifiedError }> {
  if (!isValidOrganizationContext(context)) {
    return {
      error: new AuthorizationError(
        'Invalid organization context',
        undefined,
        { providedContext: context }
      )
    }
  }

  try {
    const data = await operation(context)
    return { data }
  } catch (error) {
    if (error instanceof ClassifiedError) {
      return { error }
    }

    return {
      error: new DatabaseError(
        'Database operation failed',
        error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error),
        { organizationId: context.organizationId }
      )
    }
  }
}
```

### Real-Time Error Monitoring and Recovery

```typescript
// ~/lib/monitoring/error-logger.ts
interface ErrorLogEntry {
  timestamp: string
  level: 'error' | 'warn' | 'info'
  message: string

}

export class StructuredLogger {
  async logError(
    error: unknown,
    context: Partial<ErrorLogEntry['context']> = {},
    metadata?: Record<string, unknown>
  ): Promise<void> {
    const entry: ErrorLogEntry = {
      timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
      level: 'error',
      message: error instanceof Error ? error.message : String(error),
      error: error instanceof Error ? {
        name: error.name,
        message: error.message,
        stack: error.stack,
        digest: error instanceof ClassifiedError
          ? generateErrorDigest(error)
          : undefined
      } : undefined,
      context: {
        requestId: generateRequestId(),

## 9. Progressive Enhancement Architecture

### Server-First Progressive Enhancement Foundation

**Core Progressive Enhancement Philosophy**
- Server-first architecture where baseline functionality works without JavaScript ensuring accessibility and performance by default
- Progressive layer of enhancements providing improved user experience for users with modern browsers and fast connections
- Default to Server Components with selective client-side hydration minimizing JavaScript execution overhead and bundle size
- Content-first rendering ensuring users see meaningful content immediately with enhancement layers loading progressively

**React 19 Server Components Integration**
```typescript
// Server Component - Works without JavaScript
export default async function IssuesPage() {
  const issues = await getIssues(); // Server-side data fetching

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Static content renders first */}
      <IssuesList issues={issues} />

      {/* Progressive enhancement with Client Components */}
      <Suspense fallback={<FilterSkeleton />}>
        <IssueFilters /> {/* Client Component for interactivity */}
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}

// Client Component - Hydrates selectively
'use client'
function InteractiveNote({ note }) {
  const [expanded, setExpanded] = useState(false);

  return (
    <article>
      {/* Static content always visible */}
      <h3>{note.title}</h3>
      <p>{note.preview}</p>

      {/* Enhanced functionality */}
      <button onClick={() => setExpanded(!expanded)}>
        {expanded ? 'Collapse' : 'Expand'}
      </button>
      {expanded && <div>{note.fullContent}</div>}
    </article>
  );
}
```

### Form Functionality Without JavaScript

**Server Actions Progressive Enhancement**
```typescript
// Server Action - works without JavaScript
'use server'
async function createIssue(formData: FormData) {
  const title = formData.get('title') as string;
  const description = formData.get('description') as string;

  // Validate and save with organization scoping
  const issue = await db.issues.create({
    title,
    description,
    organizationId: getOrgId()
  });

  // Progressive enhancement: redirect vs. return data
  redirect(`/issues/${issue.id}`);
}

// Form Component - Progressive enhancement ready
export default function CreateIssueForm() {
  return (
    <form action={createIssue}>
      <div>
        <label htmlFor="title">Issue Title</label>
        <input
          id="title"
          name="title"
          required
          type="text"
        />
      </div>

      <div>
        <label htmlFor="description">Description</label>
        <textarea
          id="description"
          name="description"
          required
        />
      </div>

      {/* Works without JavaScript */}
      <button type="submit">Create Issue</button>
    </form>
  );
}
```

**Enhanced Form with Client-Side Features**
```typescript
'use client'
import { useActionState } from 'react';

export default function EnhancedCreateIssueForm() {
  const [state, formAction, pending] = useActionState(createIssue, null);

  return (
    <form action={formAction}>
      {/* Same form fields with progressive enhancement */}

      {/* Progressive enhancement features */}
      {state?.errors?.title && (
        <p role="alert" className="error">{state.errors.title}</p>
      )}

      <button
        type="submit"
        disabled={pending}
        aria-busy={pending}
      >
        {pending ? 'Creating...' : 'Create Issue'}
      </button>

      {/* Optimistic UI */}
      {pending && <div>Your issue is being created...</div>}
    </form>
  );
}
```

### Client Island Architecture and Hydration Boundaries

**Strategic Hydration Boundary Implementation**
```typescript
// Server Component shell
export default async function DashboardPage() {
  const [stats, recentIssues] = await Promise.all([
    getStats(),
    getRecentIssues()
  ]);

  return (
    <main>
      {/* Static content - no hydration needed */}
      <StatsDisplay stats={stats} />

      {/* Hydration boundary #1: Search functionality */}
      <Suspense fallback={<SearchSkeleton />}>
        <SearchIsland />
      </Suspense>

      {/* Static list with progressive enhancement */}
      <IssuesList issues={recentIssues} />

      {/* Hydration boundary #2: Interactive filters */}
      <Suspense fallback={<FiltersSkeleton />}>
        <FiltersIsland />
      </Suspense>
    </main>
  );
}

// Selective hydration with Activity boundaries
function TabContainer() {
  const [activeTab, setActiveTab] = useState('issues');

  return (
    <>
      <TabButtons activeTab={activeTab} onChange={setActiveTab} />

      {/* Each tab is an independent hydration island */}
      <Activity mode={activeTab === "issues" ? "visible" : "hidden"}>
        <IssuesTab />
      </Activity>

      <Activity mode={activeTab === "reports" ? "visible" : "hidden"}>
        <ReportsTab />
      </Activity>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Accessibility-First Progressive Enhancement

**WCAG 2025 Compliance Architecture**
```typescript
// Accessible progressive enhancement following WCAG 2.2+ standards
export default function AccessibleDataTable({ data }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Always accessible table structure */}
      <table role="table" aria-label="Issues list">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th scope="col">Title</th>
            <th scope="col">Status</th>
            <th scope="col">Priority</th>
            <th scope="col">Actions</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          {data.map(issue => (
            <tr key={issue.id}>
              <td>
                <a href={`/issues/${issue.id}`}>{issue.title}</a>
              </td>
              <td>
                <span
                  className={`status status-${issue.status}`}
                  aria-label={`Status: ${issue.status}`}
                >
                  {issue.status}
                </span>
              </td>
              <td>{issue.priority}</td>
              <td>
                {/* Progressive enhancement: works without JS */}
                <form action={updateIssueStatus} method="post">
                  <input type="hidden" name="id" value={issue.id} />
                  <select
                    name="status"
                    defaultValue={issue.status}
                    aria-label={`Update status for ${issue.title}`}
                  >
                    <option value="open">Open</option>
                    <option value="in-progress">In Progress</option>
                    <option value="closed">Closed</option>
                  </select>
                  <button type="submit">Update</button>
                </form>
              </td>
            </tr>
          ))}
        </tbody>
      </table>

      {/* Enhanced features with proper ARIA */}
      <Suspense fallback={null}>
        <EnhancedTableFeatures />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Screen Reader Optimization with Live Regions**
```typescript
'use client'
export default function LiveUpdates() {
  const [status, setStatus] = useState('');

  return (
    <div>
      {/* Screen readers announce changes */}
      <div
        role="status"
        aria-live="polite"
        aria-atomic="true"
        className="sr-only"
      >
        {status}
      </div>

      {/* Visual updates */}
      <div aria-hidden="true">
        {status && <div className="notification">{status}</div>}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Performance Optimization Through Progressive Loading

**Core Web Vitals 2025 Optimization Strategy**
```typescript
// Request-level caching for performance
import { cache } from 'react';

const getCachedIssues = cache(async (orgId: string) => {
  return await db.query.issues.findMany({
    where: eq(issues.organizationId, orgId)
  });
});

// Progressive loading with proper metrics optimization
export default async function OptimizedIssuePage({ orgId }) {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Immediate LCP content */}
      <h1>Issues Dashboard</h1>

      {/* Critical above-the-fold content */}
      <Suspense fallback={<IssuesListSkeleton />}>
        <IssuesList orgId={orgId} />
      </Suspense>

      {/* Below-the-fold: lazy load */}
      <Suspense fallback={<ChartsSkeleton />}>
        <IssueCharts orgId={orgId} />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Progressive Image Enhancement**
```typescript
// Progressive image enhancement with Next.js optimization
import Image from 'next/image';

export function ProgressiveImage({ src, alt, priority = false }) {
  return (
    <div className="image-container">
      {/* Base64 placeholder loads immediately */}
      <Image
        src={src}
        alt={alt}
        priority={priority}
        sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 50vw"
        placeholder="blur"
        blurDataURL="data:image/jpeg;base64,..."
        style={{
          width: '100%',
          height: 'auto',
        }}
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Network Resilience and Offline Capability Patterns

**Service Worker Integration for Progressive Enhancement**
```javascript
// public/sw.js - Progressive web app enhancement
self.addEventListener('fetch', (event) => {
  // Cache-first strategy for static assets
  if (event.request.destination === 'script' ||
      event.request.destination === 'style') {
    event.respondWith(
      caches.match(event.request)
        .then(response => response || fetch(event.request))
    );
  }

  // Network-first for API calls with fallback
  if (event.request.url.includes('/api/')) {
    event.respondWith(
      fetch(event.request)
        .catch(() => caches.match(event.request))
    );
  }
});
```

**Offline-First Form Handling with Progressive Enhancement**
```typescript
'use client'
export function OfflineCapableForm() {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(true);

  useEffect(() => {
    setIsOnline(navigator.onLine);

    const handleOnline = () => setIsOnline(true);
    const handleOffline = () => setIsOnline(false);

    window.addEventListener('online', handleOnline);
    window.addEventListener('offline', handleOffline);

    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('online', handleOnline);
      window.removeEventListener('offline', handleOffline);
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <form action={createIssue}>
      {/* Form fields */}

      {!isOnline && (
        <div role="alert" className="offline-notice">
          You're offline. Your form will be submitted when connection resumes.
        </div>
      )}

      <button type="submit">
        {isOnline ? 'Submit' : 'Save for Later'}
      </button>
    </form>
  );
}
```
