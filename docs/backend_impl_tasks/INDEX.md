# Index of docs/backend_impl_tasks

This directory contains detailed implementation tasks for Phase 1A of the PinPoint backend refactor. These tasks implement the complete V1.0 schema with an RBAC system as documented in `docs/planning/backend_impl_plan.md`. The tasks are organized to follow a specific execution workflow with dependencies.

- **[completed/](./completed/)**: This subdirectory contains documentation for backend implementation tasks that have been successfully completed. Each document details the objective, implementation steps, and validation for a specific task, serving as a record of completed work.
- **[10-redesign-pinballmap-integration.md](./10-redesign-pinballmap-integration.md)**: This task focuses on completely redesigning the PinballMap integration service to align with the new V1.0 schema. It addresses issues arising from schema changes, such as the removal of `pinballMapId` from the Location model and the renaming of `GameTitle`/`GameInstance` to `Model`/`Machine`. The task includes enhancing the schema to support geographic data, cross-database references (IPDB/OPDB), and a modern integration architecture, ensuring the sync functionality is fully restored and enhanced.
- **[12-implement-qr-code-system.md](./12-implement-qr-code-system.md)**: This document outlines the implementation of a QR code generation and scanning system for machines. The objective is to enable users to scan a QR code on a machine and report an issue, potentially attaching a photo. The task involves adding QR code fields to the Machine model, creating a dedicated QR code service, and developing a tRPC router and public API route for QR code resolution and generation.
- **[14-implement-collections-system.md](./14-implement-collections-system.md)**: This task details the implementation of a collections system to support advanced machine grouping and filtering. It aims to enable organizations to create both manual collections (e.g., "Front Room") and auto-generated collections (e.g., "Manufacturer", "Era") for powerful filtering on location pages. The implementation involves enhancing `Collection` models, updating the `Machine` and `Location` models, and creating a `CollectionService` and tRPC router.
- **[CLAUDE.md](./CLAUDE.md)**: This file provides instructions and context for the Claude AI model, guiding its operations within this directory. It ensures that the AI agent understands its role and responsibilities when interacting with the backend implementation tasks.
- **[MULTI_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md](./MULTI_AGENT_WORKFLOW.md)**: This document defines the coordinated workflow for multiple AI agents working in parallel on PinPoint backend tasks using Git worktrees. It outlines the initial setup, daily synchronization procedures, conflict management strategies, and quality standards to ensure efficient and collaborative development while maintaining code quality.
