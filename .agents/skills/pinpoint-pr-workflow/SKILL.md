# PinPoint PR Workflow

End-to-end pipeline from "I have changes" to "merged in main". Replaces the deprecated pinpoint-commit, pinpoint-ready-to-review, and pinpoint-github-monitor skills.

## When to use — pick your entry phase

- Uncommitted changes in tree → **Phase 1: Commit**
- Local commits, no PR yet → **Phase 2: PR**
- PR open, CI not yet green-and-clean → **Phase 3: Review**
- `ready-for-review` label applied → **Phase 4: Merge**

---

## Phase 1: Commit

### 1.1 Branch validation

- Verify NOT on main: `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` ≠ `main`.
- Verify branch follows naming convention: `feature/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*`, `docs/*`, `test/*`, `refactor/*`.
- Verify based on current main: `git merge-base HEAD origin/main` is recent.
- Verify NO `git rebase origin/main` ever — commandment 18 (use `git merge origin/main` instead).

### 1.2 Pre-commit validation

Default to `pnpm run check` (~12s; covers type, lint, format, unit tests, yamllint, actionlint, ruff, shellcheck). Use `pnpm run preflight` (full + integration) before commit for non-trivial changes, especially: migrations, security/auth changes, server actions, middleware.

### 1.3 E2E selection

Use this matrix based on `git diff --name-only --staged`. **Never run `e2e:full` / `e2e:all` locally — the full suite is CI's job.** Locally, run only targeted specs (`pnpm exec playwright test <spec> --project=chromium`) while writing them or iterating on a feature they touch.

| Changed file patterns                                                                                | Recommended local check                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `src/app/**/page.tsx`, `src/app/**/layout.tsx`, `src/app/(auth)/**`                                  | Targeted spec(s) for the affected flow while iterating; CI runs the full suite |
| `src/components/issues/*`, `src/components/machines/*`, `src/server/actions/*`, `src/lib/supabase/*` | Targeted spec(s) while iterating; CI runs the full suite                       |
| `supabase/migrations/*`, `src/server/db/schema.ts`                                                   | `pnpm run preflight` (includes smoke E2E)                                      |
| `src/components/ui/*`, `src/lib/*` (non-supabase)                                                    | `pnpm run smoke` (~60s; already in preflight)                                  |
| `docs/**`, `*.test.ts`, `*.spec.ts`, `.agents/**`, `scripts/*`                                       | skip additional E2E                                                            |

### 1.4 Commit message

Conventional commits: `<type>(<scope>): <description>`.

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `chore`, `docs`, `test`, `style`.

PinPoint scopes: `issues`, `machines`, `auth`, `ui`, `db`, `e2e`, `agents`, `workflow`, `hooks`, `forms`, `notifications`, etc. — use the most-affected area.

### 1.5 Push

If branch has no upstream: `git push -u origin <branch-name>`. Else: `git push`.

Verify upstream tracks the branch itself, NOT main: `git branch -vv` should show `[origin/<your-branch>]`.

---

## Phase 2: PR

### 2.1 Open the PR

Prefer MCP `create_pull_request` for typed argument handling. Or use `gh pr create` if you're already in a shell context.

MCP example:

- Tool: `mcp__github__create_pull_request`
- Args: `owner: "timothyfroehlich"`, `repo: "PinPoint"`, `title: "<title>"`, `body: "<description>"`, `head: "<branch>"`, `base: "main"`, `draft: false` (ready-for-review by default — see 2.3)

### 2.2 PR description template

```
## Summary

- [1-3 bullets summarizing what changed and why]

## Test Plan

- [ ] [bulleted markdown checklist of TODOs for testing the PR]

## Related Issues

Closes #N (if applicable)
```

### 2.3 Draft vs ready

**Default: open ready-for-review, not draft** — CI runs the same on drafts, so draft gates nothing. Use draft ONLY while you're still iterating, when you want title/description feedback first, or when you've said you're pausing mid-task. Don't reflexively open as draft.

---

## Phase 3: Review (CI + label)

### 3.1 Watch CI

Use Monitor tool with `pr-watch.py`:

```
Monitor(
command: "./scripts/workflow/pr-watch.py <PR>",
description: "CI watch for PR #<PR>",
persistent: false,
timeout_ms: 3600000
)
```

Exit 0 = all passed. Exit 1 = failure — read `tmp/gh-monitor/failure-<RUN_ID>.md`.

### 3.2 Check for review comments

If the PR has review comments (from Tim or another agent), read them via MCP:

```
mcp__github__pull_request_read(
method: "get_review_comments",
owner: "timothyfroehlich",
repo: "PinPoint",
pullNumber: <PR>,
perPage: 100
)
```

Returns array of review threads. Each thread has:

- `is_resolved` (snake_case! not camelCase)
- `is_outdated`
- `comments[]` with `path`, `line`, `body`, `author.login`, `html_url`, and crucially a thread node ID for resolving

### 3.3 Address review comments

For each unresolved thread, evaluate critically. Not all suggestions warrant code changes.

**To fix**: edit code, commit, push, then resolve the thread.

**To decline**: post a one-sentence justification reply AND resolve the thread:

1. Reply:

```
mcp__github__add_reply_to_pull_request_comment(
owner: "timothyfroehlich",
repo: "PinPoint",
pullNumber: <PR>,
commentId: <commentId from thread>,
body: "Ignored: <one-sentence justification>. —Claude-<YourName>"
)
```

2. Resolve:

```
mcp__github__pull_request_review_write(
method: "resolve_thread",
threadId: <PRRT_kwDOxxx from thread>,
owner: "timothyfroehlich",
repo: "PinPoint",
pullNumber: <PR>
)
```

(Owner/repo/pullNumber not actually used for resolve_thread but tool requires them per schema.)

Sign replies with your agent name (`—Claude-Plunger`, `—Claude-Spinner`, etc.).

### 3.4 Apply `ready-for-review` label

Once CI green + zero unresolved review threads + no merge conflict:

1. Read current labels via `pull_request_read(method: "get")` and extract `.labels[]`.
2. Build new labels array: existing labels + `"ready-for-review"`.
3. Apply:

```
mcp__github__issue_write(
method: "update",
owner: "timothyfroehlich",
repo: "PinPoint",
issue_number: <PR>,
labels: [<existing>, "ready-for-review"]
)
```

NOTE: PR labels are added via the issues endpoint. `labels` parameter is full-replacement, so read current labels first to avoid clobbering.

The label is a hint to Tim that the PR is ready. `merge-pr.sh` re-checks all gates at merge time regardless.

---

## Phase 4: Merge

Direct `gh pr merge` and MCP `merge_pull_request` are blocked by hook. Use `merge-pr.sh`.

### 4.1 Invoke

```
bash scripts/workflow/merge-pr.sh <PR>
```

Flags (stackable, order-independent):

- `--dry-run` — preview only, no action.
- `--bypass-merge-requirements` — bypass `ci` gate AND pass `--admin` to `gh pr merge`,
  overriding GitHub branch-protection rules. Requires manual permission approval.

The `no_conflict` gate is NEVER bypassable — GitHub rejects conflicting merges regardless of `--admin`.

### 4.2 Interpret output

Script emits structured status tokens:

| Token                    | Meaning                                                | What to do                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `PASS: <gate>: <state>`  | Gate passed                                            | Continue                              |
| `FAIL: <gate>: <state>`  | Gate failed                                            | Fix underlying issue, push, retry     |
| `WAIT: <gate>: <state>`  | Transient (e.g., GitHub computing mergeable)           | Retry merge-pr.sh after a few seconds |
| `BLOCK: <gate>: <state>` | State mismatch requiring action (e.g., merge conflict) | Resolve, push, retry                  |

On any FAIL: script removes `ready-for-review` label if present (the label's contract is "click-merge-without-thinking"; if a gate fails at merge time, that contract is broken). Exit 1.

On all PASS: script captures head SHA, calls `gh pr merge <PR> --squash --match-head-commit=<sha>`. TOCTOU-safe — if a new commit lands between gate check and merge, GitHub rejects the merge (`--match-head-commit` mismatch). Branch deletion is handled by the repo's auto-delete-branches setting, not by the merge command — passing `--delete-branch` from a worktree fails local cleanup because main is held by the root checkout.

### 4.3 Escape hatches

**`--bypass-merge-requirements`** — for CI/branch-protection issues:

- A required check is failing for known-irrelevant reasons (infrastructure flake, unrelated job)
  AND you've manually verified the change is safe
- An emergency hotfix where waiting for CI is not acceptable

Do NOT bypass when:

- Merge conflict exists (`no_conflict` gate is never bypassable; conflicts can't be ignored)
- You haven't manually verified the underlying state. The flag requires manual permission approval
  in the chat — treat the approval prompt as a "are you sure?" checkpoint.

### 4.4 Bypass the hook (emergency only)

If you absolutely need to bypass the hook (e.g., merge-pr.sh itself is broken and you have a hotfix to ship):

```bash
touch .claude-merge-bypass
gh pr merge <PR> --squash
```

The sentinel is single-use — deleted on the next merge attempt. Document in commit message WHY you bypassed.

### 4.5 Dependabot PRs: rebase before merging back-to-back

When two or more Dependabot PRs that both touch `pnpm-lock.yaml` (or any lockfile) are open simultaneously, merging them in succession without rebasing the second-and-later PRs can silently break the lockfile.

**The trap:** each Dependabot PR's lockfile diff adds entries in slightly different alphabetical zones based on its own snapshot of main. After the first PR merges, git's textual three-way merge of the second PR doesn't see a conflict because the additions live in non-overlapping line ranges — but both PRs may add the _same_ transitive dep (e.g., `brace-expansion@5.0.6`). The squash-merge produces a lockfile with a duplicated mapping key, which `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` rejects with `ERR_PNPM_BROKEN_LOCKFILE`. Every new PR's `Setup Dependencies` then fails until main is fixed.

**Why `rebase-strategy: auto` in `.github/dependabot.yml` doesn't save you:** "auto" means Dependabot rebases when _the dependency version_ is out of date, not when _the lockfile region_ has shifted under it. Two independent Dependabot PRs against the same main can both stay "current" by Dependabot's definition while their lockfile diffs collide on merge.

**Rule:** when merging the first of two or more Dependabot PRs that both touch a lockfile, comment `@dependabot rebase` on each remaining Dependabot PR before merging it. Dependabot regenerates the lockfile against post-first-merge main and the duplicate is deduped automatically. Wait for the rebased CI to pass before invoking `merge-pr.sh` on the second PR.

**Casework:** 2026-05-19 — PRs #1379 and #1381 each added `brace-expansion@5.0.6:` to `packages:` independently. Both merged within ~1 minute. Main's `Setup Dependencies` broke until a manual dedup of `pnpm-lock.yaml` was bundled into PR #1383 alongside that PR's primary E2E locator fix.

**Quick triage check before merging the second of two open Dependabot PRs:**

```bash
# How many commits is the PR's branch behind origin/main?
# behind_by > 0 means the PR's lockfile snapshot predates current main.
pr_branch=$(gh pr view <second_pr> --json headRefName --jq .headRefName)
gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/compare/main...$pr_branch" --jq '.behind_by'
```

If `behind_by > 0`, comment `@dependabot rebase` on the PR and wait for the rebased CI to pass before invoking `merge-pr.sh`. Do not use `gh pr view --json baseRefOid` for this — `baseRefOid` is the base branch's current SHA at query time, so it always equals `origin/main` and cannot detect a stale PR head.

## MCP gotchas reference

- **snake_case fields**: responses use `is_resolved`, `submitted_at`, `head.sha`, `commit.committer.date`. Not camelCase.
- **Pagination**: cap `perPage` to 100 on list methods. Use cursor pagination via `after` for GraphQL.
- **Labels are full-replacement**: `issue_write(method: "update", labels: [...])` REPLACES the entire label set. Read current first.
- **`resolve_thread` ignores owner/repo/pullNumber**: only `threadId` matters, but the schema requires the others.
- **Thread IDs**: `PRRT_kwDOxxx` format from `get_review_comments` output.

## Status token reference

Same as in `scripts/workflow/AGENTS.md` and emitted by `merge-pr.sh`, `pr-watch.py`, and `_pr-gates.sh`.
