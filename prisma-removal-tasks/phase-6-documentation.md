# Phase 6: Documentation Updates

**Timeline**: 1 day  
**Impact**: Low - Developer experience and onboarding  
**Approach**: Systematic review and update of all documentation files  

## üéØ Overview

Update all project documentation to reflect the completed Drizzle-only state. Remove Prisma references, update migration status, and ensure documentation accurately represents the current system architecture.

**Why Phase 6**: Documentation must accurately reflect the system state for future development, onboarding, and maintenance.

## üîß Documentation Update Strategy

### **Systematic Search and Replace**

**Search Terms to Find and Update:**
- "Prisma" (context-dependent replacement)
- "dual-ORM" ‚Üí "Drizzle"  
- "migration in progress" ‚Üí "migration complete"
- "Phase 2B" ‚Üí "Completed"
- "parallel validation" ‚Üí remove references
- "ctx.prisma" ‚Üí "ctx.db"
- "@prisma/client" ‚Üí "drizzle-orm"

### **Content Categories to Update**

**Remove Entirely:**
- Migration planning content (archive or mark complete)
- Dual-ORM development patterns  
- Parallel validation instructions
- Router conversion procedures

**Update for Current State:**
- Tech stack descriptions
- Development setup instructions
- Code examples and snippets
- Architecture diagrams (if any)

**Add New Content:**
- Migration completion summary
- Lessons learned from migration
- Drizzle-only best practices
- Performance improvements achieved

## üîç File-by-File Priorities

### **High-Impact Files (Update First):**

1. **`CLAUDE.md`** - Primary project instructions
2. **`README.md`** - First impression for new developers
3. **`docs/migration/supabase-drizzle/direct-conversion-plan.md`** - Migration status
4. **`docs/quick-reference/migration-patterns.md`** - Daily development reference

### **Medium-Impact Files:**

5. **Migration documentation** - Historical record and lessons learned
6. **Developer guides** - Ongoing development patterns  
7. **Architecture documentation** - System understanding
8. **Testing guides** - Development workflow support

### **Low-Impact Files (Update Last):**

9. **Inline code comments** - Developer context
10. **Specialized documentation** - Edge cases and advanced topics

## üö¶ Documentation Review Process

### **For Each Documentation File:**

1. **Content Audit** - Identify all Prisma references and migration content
2. **Relevance Assessment** - Determine if content should be updated, archived, or removed
3. **Update Execution** - Make necessary changes for Drizzle-only context
4. **Accuracy Verification** - Ensure updated content matches current system state
5. **Cross-Reference Check** - Verify links and references still work

### **Quality Standards:**

- **Accuracy** - All technical information reflects current system
- **Completeness** - No missing information for Drizzle-only development
- **Clarity** - Clear, unambiguous instructions and examples  
- **Consistency** - Consistent terminology and patterns across documents

**Next Phase**: Phase 7 (Dependency Cleanup) - Remove Prisma packages and build configurations

**Dependencies**: Phases 1-5 completion recommended (to ensure documentation matches reality)
**Blockers**: None identified
**Estimated Completion**: 1 day of systematic documentation review

**Approach**: Start with high-impact files (CLAUDE.md, README.md) and work systematically through the documentation tree, using search tools to identify all Prisma references.
